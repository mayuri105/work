KAT counts more than 50 million unique monthly visitors and is estimated to be the 68th most frequently visited website on the internet -- according to Alexa.</p><p xss="removed"><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/file/877591/download" xss="removed">In a 48-page criminal complaint</a> (PDF) filed with the U.S. District Court in Chicago, the U.S. Attorney''s Office reveals how it was able to track Vaulin. Jared Der-Yeghiayan, a special agent with the US Department of Homeland Security, was tasked with tracking the man behind KAT and it''s his report that attempts to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that Vaulin should be brought to justice. This is how it played out.</p><h3 xss="removed">The fake ad</h3><p xss="removed">From November 2015, an undercover IRS Special Agent spoke with a KAT representative about hosting an advertisement that would direct visitors to an undercover site. An agreement was made and the ad, which purportedly advertised a program to study in the United States, would be placed on individual torrent listings for $300 per day. When it finally went live on March 14th 2016, a link appeared underneath the torrent download buttons for five days. It was a short campaign, but it was enough to link KAT to a Latvian bank account, one that received €28 million ($31 million) in deposits -- mainly from advertising payments -- between August 2015 and March 2016.</p><p xss="removed"><img alt="KickassTorrents" data-credit="Homeland Security" data-mep="1283197" src="https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/b3c7756061c71820afe4366256e1813a/204107183/adexample.jpg" xss="removed"></p><p xss="removed">This back-and-forth also enabled investigators to identify an important point of contact: the email address <em xss="removed">pr@kat.cr</em>. Not only was it linked to website enquiries, it was the email associated with KAT''s social media presences such as Facebook. Agents were able to obtain records from Facebook that showed the "official.KAT.fanclub." page was almost certainly associated with KAT.</p><h3 xss="removed">Apple''s involvement</h3><p xss="removed">Using basic website-tracking services, Der-Yeghiayan was able to uncover (via a reverse DNS search) the hosts of seven apparent KAT website domains: <em xss="removed">kickasstorrents.com, kat.cr, kickass.to, kat.ph, kastatic.com, thekat.tv</em> and <em xss="removed">kickass.cr</em>. This dug up two Chicago IP addresses, which were used as KAT name servers for more than four years. Agents were then able to legally gain a copy of the server''s access logs (explaining why it was federal authorities in Chicago that eventually charged Vaulin with his alleged crimes).</p><p xss="removed">Using similar tools, Homeland Security investigators also performed something called a WHOIS lookup on a domain that redirected people to the main KAT site. A WHOIS search can provide the name, address, email and phone number of a website registrant. In the case of<em xss="removed">kickasstorrents.biz, </em>that was Artem Vaulin from Kharkiv, Ukraine.</p><p xss="removed">Der-Yeghiayan was able to link the email address found in the WHOIS lookup to an Apple email address that Vaulin purportedly used to operate KAT. It''s this Apple account that appears to tie all of pieces of Vaulin''s alleged involvement together.</p><p xss="removed">On July 31st 2015, records provided by Apple show that the me.com account was used to purchase something on iTunes. The logs show that the same IP address was used on the same day to access the KAT Facebook page. After KAT began accepting Bitcoin donations in 2012, $72,767 was moved into a Coinbase account in Vaulin''s name. That Bitcoin wallet was registered with the same me.com email address.</p><h3 xss="removed">What happens now?</h3><p xss="removed">Homeland Security has already asked that the seven KAT domains named in the complaint are forfeited for their role in facilitating piracy. Verisign is expected to seize the .com and .tv domains, while Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) requests will be sent to registrars in Costa Rica, Tonga and the Philippines. Homeland Security then expects those sites to be redirected to a server of its choosing.</p><p xss="removed">Right now, KickassTorrents appears to still be up, at least via the numerous proxy services that support it. However, it''s probably only a matter of time until it becomes a lot harder to find. While investigators already had a lot of evidence before they added the iTunes transaction to the mix, the idea that a legal media purchase could be the undoing of a piracy king kinda breaks the irony meter.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>', 'f591082681ea268b4657ce35c300d629.jpg', '1', 'Jitendra Gautam', NULL, '2016-07-21 13:06:02'),

And with the expenses rising up with every passing day, it is smart to do a grocery budget control. Do you know that there are ways to save at the Grocery Store? This doesn’t only give boost to your savings zone, but also ensures better expenditure and allows you to add to your shopping cart what is actually needed. So if you have been spending excessively on your groceries and want to draw the strings a bit tighter to ensure you don’t waste money, here are smart tips to use.</p><p xss="removed">• <strong xss="removed">Purchase vegetables and fruits that are in-season</strong> – Healthy living is not always about going out of the way to buy pomegranate or radish, when it’s not the season. This is where most people go wrong and end up spending twice the original amount and some even more. Whereas if you could concentrate on the in-season harvests, then you don’t just save money, but also get yourself fresh buys that is of a good taste and keeps you healthy as well.</p><p xss="removed">• <strong xss="removed">Make use of online coupons</strong> – <span xss="removed">Coupons</span><span xss="removed"> </span>are becoming the new age shopping tool! When you are surfing the internet make it a point to look up coupon sites for instance CouponNetwork.com or Coupons.com. Sites such these two are the best ones to access your coupons. Go a step further and leverage from social media networking. Log in with your Facebook and Twitter accounts, like the profile/pages of your favourite brands. This way you are up for the coupon deals that the brands sometimes shell out on social media as a brand promotion strategy.</p><p xss="removed">• <strong xss="removed">Check out substitutes</strong> – One must do exercising a tad bit of discretion! For instance, if you are in the habit of having cornflakes with your favourite’s breakfast and it’s not the season for those fruits.

Films that indulge in strong (read bold) language, suggestive (read vulgar) scenes, gender taboos, Kashmir issues, religion and basically movies which are way ahead of its time.</p><p class="selectionShareable" xss=removed>Here''s a list of movies which the Censor Board banned, not that the viewers missed any of it!</p><h2 xss=removed>1. Bandit Queen (1994)</h2><p class="selectionShareable" xss=removed>Bandit Queen was straight up ''offensive'', ''vulgar'', ''indecent'' and almost laughed at the cinematic conservatism of the Indian censor board. The subject was such. Based on the life of Phoolan Devi, this Shekhar Kapur movie was banned due its <span xss=removed>explicit sexual content, nudity and abusive language, which the Censor Board could not (obviously) digest.</span></p><figure class="sw-media" xss=removed><img src="https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/gau/156th/1.jpg" xss=removed></figure><p class="sw-source selectionShareable" xss=removed>Source: <a href="http://www.moviegazetteonline.com/blu-rays/bandit-queen-blu-ray/" xss=removed>moviegazetteonline</a></p><h2 xss=removed>2. Fire (1996)</h2><p class="selectionShareable" xss=removed>Deepa Mehta''s work is recognised for its global content and appeal. However, closer home, that translates to controversy.  Among others, one such movie was ''Fire'' which garnered a lot of critical acclaim worldwide but failed to impress Hindu groups (like Shiv Sena) in India due to its subject, which dealt with lesbian relationship between two sisters-in-laws in a Hindu family. The controversy ended with the leading actors, Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das along with their director Deepa Mehta receiving death threats and Censor Board finally  banning the movie in the country.</p><figure class="sw-media" xss=removed><img src="https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/gau/156th/2.jpg" xss=removed></figure><p class="sw-source selectionShareable" xss=removed>Source: <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/513-fire/backdrops" xss=removed>themoviedb</a></p><h2 xss=removed>3. Kama Sutra - A Tale Of Love (1996)</h2><p class="selectionShareable" xss=removed>In a rather hypocritical move, <em xss=removed>Kama Sutra - A Tale Of Love </em>too faced the wrath of Censor Board <em xss=removed></em>which termed it ''explicit'', ''unethical'' and ''immoral'' for the audiences of the nation which came up with the concept of Kama Sutra! This Mira Nair movie, which depicted the lives of four lovers in the 16th century in India, was a hit with the critics but a major flop with the Censor Board and ultimately got banned.

The movie traces the journey of the protagonist after a hit-man''s car and a winning lottery ticket goes missing and the chaos that follows. However, what irked the Censor Board were the ''vulgar scenes'' and ''bold language'' used in this black comedy, which ultimately led to a ban on the movie.</p><figure class="sw-media" xss=removed><img src="https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/gau/156th/4.jpg" xss=removed></figure><p class="sw-source selectionShareable" xss=removed>Source: <a href="http://moviesoye.blogspot.in/2010/11/urf-professor-2010-bollywood-watch-full.html" xss=removed>moviesoye</a></p><h2 xss=removed>5.

Parzania (2005)</h2><p class="selectionShareable" xss=removed>Parzania cut open the wounds of Gujarat''s scarred past, and received backlash and appreciation in equal amounts. The film was based on a superb plot which revolved around a boy called Azhar who goes missing during the Gujarat riots in the year 2002.  Even though the film won a National Award, its cinematic excellence was not considered enough for political parties to let it screen in Gujarat, where it was fiercely banned.</p><figure class="sw-media" xss=removed><img src="https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/gau/156th/8.jpg" xss=removed></figure><p class="sw-source selectionShareable" xss=removed>Source: <a href="http://www.moviesreporter.net/parzania-2005/" xss=removed>moviesreporter</a></p><h2 xss=removed>9.

They thought the film projected Catholicism in a very immoral light. The Censor Board too, had issues with the nude scenes in the film and hence the movie did not see the light of the day.</p><figure class="sw-media" xss=removed><img src="https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/gau/156th/9.jpg" xss=removed></figure><p class="sw-source selectionShareable" xss=removed>Source: <a href="http://detuik.co.id/2005-bollywood-movie/" xss=removed>detuik</a></p><h2 xss=removed>10. Water (2005)</h2><p class="selectionShareable" xss=removed>Water is another Deepa Mehta movie which courted a lot of controversy because of its dark insights on the life of the Indian widow. Set in a certain Ashram of Varanasi, the script of the movie was written by none other than Anurag Kashyap and took up controversial issues <span xss=removed>like ostracism and misogyny which were alien to the Indian Censor Board back then. No wonder, the movie was widely attacked by protesters and around 2000 fanatics even destroyed the sets of the film.</span></p><figure class="sw-media" xss=removed><img src="https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/gau/156th/10.jpg" xss=removed></figure><p class="sw-source selectionShareable" xss=removed>Source: <a href="http://www.impawards.com/2006/water_ver4_xlg.html" xss=removed>impawards</a></p><h2 xss=removed>11. Firaaq (2008)</h2><p class="selectionShareable" xss=removed>Another film to deal with the Gujarat riots, Firaaq was reportedly based on true incidents which happened in the riot-torn Gujarat.  Nandita Das was widely criticised for hurting the sentiments of Hindus and Muslims and ultimately the movie got banned. But what came as a major achievement was the fact that the movie finally saw a release date and upon its release, garnered rave reviews from critics and audiences alike.</p><figure class="sw-media" xss=removed><img src="https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/gau/156th/11.jpg" xss=removed></figure><p class="sw-source selectionShareable" xss=removed>Source: <a href="http://www.santabanta.com/photos/firaaq/1457000.htm" xss=removed>santabanta</a></p><h2 xss=removed>12. Gandu (2010)</h2><p class="selectionShareable" xss=removed>If you expected anything else from a movie named ''Gandu'', you''d definitely be disappointed. The Bengali movie was a rap musical which created a lot of buzz for its oral sex scenes and nudity. Shot in white and black format, the movie was banned because it ''defied Indian sensibilities''.</p><figure class="sw-media" xss=removed><img src="https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/gau/156th/12.jpg" xss=removed></figure><p class="sw-source selectionShareable" xss=removed>Source: <a href="http://www.glamsham.com/movies/scoops/11/jun/15-anurag-kashyap-considers-gandu-a-classic-051103.asp" xss=removed>glamsham</a></p><h2 xss=removed>13.

However, the boy is denied travelling outside the country because his father is charged with militancy.

What’s the first thing , you ask? Well, Rajinikanth, obviously! In no time, this super catchy song became a rage. But what’s very surprising is the fact that the lyrics of this killer song were written in just 20 minutes by Arunraja Kamaraj. Did you know that a Hindi version of the song was also released recently? My personal preference, however remains the Tamil one. But in case you haven’t heard the Hindi one, check it out right here:</p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" xss="removed">&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DONeA0dmgu8" width="560" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; width: 662.219px;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p><h3 xss="removed">2. All Rajinikanth movies have at least one song by SP Balasubramanian, except for this one!</h3><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" xss="removed">Ever since 1992, popular singer SP Balasubramanian has always lent his voice to at least one of the songs in a Rajini movie, but breaks a record of almost 24 years. This film doesn’t involve the singer at all.<br><br></p><h3 xss="removed">3.<span xss="removed"> </span>Instead of a gangster film, Kabali could have been a sci-fi supernatural film</h3><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" xss="removed"> </p><p xss="removed"><img id="ed-img" title="Rajinikanth" src="http://media.indiatimes.in/media/content/2016/Jul/kabali-teaser-release_1469210837.jpg" alt="Rajinikanth" xss="removed"></p><p xss="removed"><span class="source_link" xss="removed">YouTube</span></p><p xss="removed">The makers initially presented two scripts to Rajinikanth. One was the gangster theme and the other one was a sci-fi supernatural drama. He left the choice on Thalaiva. And obviously, Rajinikanth chose the gangster version of the film.</p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" xss="removed"> </p><h3 xss="removed">4.<span xss="removed"> </span>Rajinikanth worked with an entirely new cast and crew instead of his regular one with this film</h3><p class="MsoNormal" xss="removed">In most of his films, Rajinikanth has always worked with established directors, music composers, cinematographers, actors and crew members. But with <em xss="removed">Kabali</em>, he broke this tradition as the director, music composer, cast and crew are new and inexperienced. </p><h3 xss="removed">5.<span xss="removed"> </span>The actual person behind this film  is Rajini’s daughter - Soundarya</h3><p class="MsoNormal" xss="removed">She was the one who approached filmmaker Pa Ranjith after she heard praises about him from her father. Rajinikanth was full of praises for his film <em xss="removed">Madras</em> which is actually Ranjith’s second film. This inspired Soundarya ad she then approached him. Needless to say, Ranjith was super excited and scared to work with the Superstar in just his third movie. So in a way, <em xss="removed">Kabali</em> came about all thanks to Soundarya. <br><br></p><h3 xss="removed">6. This movie is based on the life of a real don!</h3><p class="MsoNormal" xss="removed">Speculations were rife about the film being inspired by a real person’s life. Turns out these speculations are actually true. Apparently, the Rajinikanth starrer is loosely based on the life of a gangster called Kabaleeshwaran who hails from Mylapore in Chennai.</p><h3 xss="removed">7.

He will make an entry in <em xss="removed">Kabali</em> after the first 15 minutes of the film. This makes it the second Rajini film where his character is introduced so late. The first was the 1991 film <em xss="removed">Thalapathi</em> which also had Mammootty in a crucial role. However, the only saving grace is that his entry is almost one-and-a-half minutes long and is shot in slow motion so that the audience can enjoy his comeback as a don in full swing!</p><h3 xss="removed">8.<span xss="removed"> </span>It’s the first Indian movie to release in Malay</h3><p class="MsoNormal" xss="removed">Well, if you thought that Rajinikanth’s fan following is only limited to our country, you''re mistaken! <em xss="removed">Kabali</em> will be released in more than 6000 screens worldwide. Not just that, since the major part of the film is shot in Malayasia, the makers decided to release the movie in Malay as well. The Pa Ranjith film is also releasing in Japanese and Chinese versions.</p><h3 xss="removed">9. Rajinikanth has shed his superstar persona, clichés and mannerisms for Kabali</h3><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" xss="removed">No punches and no superstar statements, Ranjith made sure that <em xss="removed">Kabali</em> is all about Rajinikanth’s acting abilities.

It''s one attribute I''ll be better off without, I know, but then it''s good to ask questions, isn''t it? At least that''s what they told me. Problems arise, ever so often might I add, when innocent questions turn into a full-fledged argument. Because the one-size-fits-all formula doesn''t really work when it comes to a verbal duel. How we say and to whom we say what we say really matters here. A straight-up and rather classic "fuck off" might be enough to put an end to the topic while arguing with a guy, but do the same to a woman, and you''re jacked. Never do that to your girlfriend, for she is known for a very specific set of skills. Skills she has mastered over the years. If you apologise and quit that''ll be the end of it. You will be forgiven, not forgotten. But if you persist, trust me. She will come after you.

The better girlfriends will always tell you if you''re digging your own grave. It''s best to take their advice here and reassess the situation. But most won''t, so always have your guard up, and in case, anything goes awry, be prepared with your opening line. A simple "what happened" might work in your favour but if she responds with a poker-faced "nothing", gear up. It''s definitely something and you are at fault so start preparing a suitable enough explanation. Suitable for her, not you.

I don''t know, it''s this superpower that they have with women I guess. In fact, I have gotten out a couple of sticky situations because of them. Gay people rock. But in case you don''t have the luxury of a gay friend, I''d advise two things - keep a cool head and stay away from topics you know will stir up a storm. Works well. Of course, you can never guess a million things your girlfriend might be touchy about, but that''s fine. It''s a learning curve, you''d be more aware next time. </p><h3 xss=removed>5.

Even if you have to call her the stupidest person on the planet. Whatever you say, say in the sweetest way possible. Throw in a "baby/ sweety /jaanu" just to be on the safer side.

This culminates a rigorous, thorough process over many months, and yields a great outcome for the company. Today''s announcement not only brings us an important step toward separating Yahoo''s operating business from our Asian asset equity stakes, it also presents exciting opportunities to accelerate Yahoo''s transformation. Among the many entities that showed interest in Yahoo, Verizon believed most in the immense value we''ve created, and in what a combination could bring our users, our advertisers, and our partners.</em></p>\r\n<p xss="removed"><em xss="removed">This is a good moment to reflect on Yahoo''s journey to date.</em></p>\r\n<p xss="removed"><em xss="removed">Yahoo is a company that changed the world.

You can clearly see that spirit, that commitment, that fight in the work we''ve done together over the past few years. We set out to transform this company - and we''ve made incredible progress. We counteracted many of the tectonic shifts of declining legacy businesses, and built a Yahoo that is unequivocally stronger, nimbler, and more modern. We tripled our mobile base to over 600 million monthly users, we invested in and built Mavens from basically zero in 2011 into $1.6B of GAAP Revenue in 2015, we streamlined and modernized every aspect of our consumer products, and, with Gemini and BrightRoll, we dramatically improved our advertiser products. This only scratches the surface of what we''ve achieved... and we all know how much hard work it took to get here.</em></p>\r\n<p xss="removed"><em xss="removed">It''s because of that hard work and resilience, that Yahoo will realize amazing opportunities in its next chapter.</em></p>', 'marissa-mayer.jpg', '1', 'Malaya Roses', NULL, '2016-07-26 11:16:14'),

For a long time, I thought off-the-shoulder styles were out of the question for me.

He did not live with us.</p><p xss=removed>My two older brothers grew up with our biological father while I grew up with my mom and step-dad. My mom didn’t want the boys. She barely had anything to do with them. She kept me because I was a girl and because she wasn’t entirely sure who my father was. I grew up believing that William James Young Sr was my father. My mom kept me away from him for most of my childhood because of my brothers, according to her.</p><p xss=removed>The brother who raped me did so during a very rare visit to our home. He was allowed to spend the night that night. He hated me. He hated that my mom kept me and had barely anything to do with him. Little did he know what I was going through.</p><p xss=removed>I didn’t tell on him until I was 11. My mom contacted the police and a woman came to our home. I had to tell her everything. My brother was arrested and sent to live in a juvenile detention facility for 4 years. His last year there, my mom took some interest in him for some reason. She started bringing my rapist home for visits. One day she made me sit at the dining room table and write a letter. She forced me to write that I had forgiven my brother and that I wanted him to come live with us. None of it was true. I was terrified of my brother. Additionally, my parents never got me any help for what he did to me. They said that they couldn’t afford it. My parents could afford new jewelry every Christmas for my mom and yearly vacations to Las Vegas but they couldn’t afford anything for me ever, not dental check ups, not doctors, nothing. I was lucky to get a coat for winter and with that I was forced to get on my knees and thank my parents repeatedly for all they did for me.</p><p xss=removed>My mom had my rapist come live with us. Then they blatantly favored him right in front of me. He was good looking. He made them laugh. My step-dad would have my brother join in in making fun of me.</p><p xss=removed>Eventually, they kicked him out when he became a serious drug user and started selling their stuff.</p><p xss=removed>I came to forgive my brother.

I thought that all kids got hit like me. I was a bad child. I didn’t clean my room when I was told to. I made too much noise. Sometimes I talked back. I ate the last pickle. I didn’t clean up my parents mess in the kitchen. I could go on.</p><p xss=removed>When my step-dad broke my finger my parents brought me to the hospital. I was told to say that I slipped and fell in the driveway. I was threatened that if I said anything else I would be hurt worse. I was too terrified of my parents to say anything but what I was told to.</p><p xss=removed>It wasn’t until my early teens that I was allowed to spend time with friends in their homes. That’s when I saw that they weren’t being beat like I was. I remember one friend talking back to her dad. I winced and cowered in anticipation. I was shocked by her father’s response. He spoke to her firmly but lovingly. I finally started to see that what was happening to me was not normal.</p><p xss=removed>At 15, I overdosed on Advil. I was questioned by many people at the hospital but I was still too terrified to speak about my parents. I blamed it all on a bad grade.</p><p xss=removed>Eventually, I started to confide in some of my friends and one friend’s mom in particular. I would tell her something and then I would be shocked and intrigued by her response. She was the one who got me to open up a little.</p><p xss=removed>At one point CPS (Child Protective Services) were notified by another friend’s mom. I told CPS a few things over the phone. The next day they showed up at my high school. I was horrified. My step-dad was a teacher at the school. I was brought to a guidance counselor’s office. I knew that the guidance counselor knew my step-dad. I was too terrified to speak. I only confirmed the few things I had told CPS on the phone. From there, a detective brought me down to the police station.</p><p xss=removed>I was brought upstairs to a room full of desks. The detective introduced me to the secretary. I recognized her name. “She knows my step-dad!” I exclaimed. The detective yelled at me saying that whatever I had to say would stay in that room. Again I was too terrified to speak about my parents. The detective started asking me if my step-dad touched my breasts “playfully or sexually.” To me it didn’t matter. I thought it was wrong that he touched me period. I couldn’t answer the detective. He kept asking me over and over again, becoming more irate everytime he asked. He was outright screaming at me. I thought about how my parents would laugh at me everytime my step-dad touched my breasts. They thought it was funny that I would get upset by him touching me. After the third time he touched me, I stood up and stormed off. That’s when my mom said, “oh we can’t even play with you!” Because she had said that, I finally answered the detective, “playfully.” That was it. That’s all he wanted to know. He was done with me.</p><p xss=removed>The detective then brought me down to CPS. I was made to sit in a worker’s cubicle. Somewhere in the room, I could here my mom and my rapist brother talking. I could hear my brother saying, “She’s lying! She’s lying!” I could hear my mom say, “He’s a respected teacher in this community!” While hearing all of this, I was questioned by the CPS worker. Again, I was too terrified to speak. At no point in time during that day was I given a safe place to talk. No one offered me a single ounce of compassion.</p><p xss=removed>I was put in a foster home that night. I spent 4 nights there. On the 5th day, my parents called me. They said all the right things. They told me that they weren’t angry. They said that they loved me, that they missed me and that they wanted me to come home. I agreed to go home.</p><p xss=removed>The CPS worker came and brought me home. She stayed and chatted with my parents for a few minutes. My parents were so polite and friendly to her. I really thought at that moment that everything was going to be okay. Then she left. My parents watched her leave. Then they turned on me and the smiles on their faces morphed into something that looked pure evil. I got a verbal beating that day that was so awful I just ran. I ran out of the house and I didn’t stop running until I got to my friend’s house a mile away. It was the friend whose mom I had confided in.</p><p xss=removed>I lived there with my friend and her mom for a few months. One day my friend and I got into an argument over something stupid like kids do. My friend decided that she didn’t want me living there anymore. Her mom went to pray about it. Five minutes later she decided to bring me home. They packed up all my stuff in a garbage bag and drove me to my parent’s house and left me there.</p><p xss=removed>I spent one night home. I endured more verbal abuse. The next day I ran away again. For some reason I ran back to the same friend’s house. This time the police were called. I told the police I was being abused. They told me they would handcuff me if they had to to bring me home. They treated me like a run away, not an abused child. They advised me to get a job or do some after school activities to keep myself out of the house. That’s what I did. CPS never did another thing for me.</p><p xss=removed> </p><h3 xss=removed>4.

He came and got me and my cats right away.</p><p class="qtext_para" xss=removed>My father never knew the abuse I endured at the hands of my step-dad. I don’t know why I never told him. My time with him was very limited as a child. What little memories I have of him were all positive. I always felt safe with my dad. He never hurt me in any way. During my rare visits, we would do whatever I wanted. He would take me to the movies or roller skating or ice skating. We would take walks and go to the park. He also protected me from my rapist brother.</p><p class="qtext_para" xss=removed>Living with my dad meant living with my rapist brother. For that reason, I only lived with my dad for one year. It was during that year that I really got to know him. He was a great man.</p><p class="qtext_para" xss=removed>When I turned 18 I got my own apartment. I worked full time and went to college full time. Because I had lived with my dad, who was poor, for the year prior to college, I was eligible for full financial aid.</p><p class="qtext_para" xss=removed>Four days before Christmas of 1992 my dad came over to my apartment. He gave me his big, bright beautiful smile and handed me a $100 bill. He told me that it was my Christmas present. I asked him why he was giving it to me so early. He just shrugged and said that he wanted me to have it. I thought about asking him to stay and play gin rummy with me. He always kicked my butt at that game. For some reason I decided not to ask him to stay. Instead I gave him a hug and a kiss and I said to him, “I love you.” He said it back to me and then left. Later that night he died of a heart attack.</p><p class="qtext_para" xss=removed>It was my dad’s death that prompted me to go to paramedic school. I became an A-EMT-I. I did EMS for 5 years before my body just couldn’t take it anymore. I was lifting and carrying patients of all sizes day in and day out. My body was damaged from the physical abuse. I worked through the pain as long as I could. From there I went to work for a hospital caring for cancer patients.</p><p xss=removed> </p><h3 class="qtext_para" xss=removed>5.

It has to do with feelings of worthlessness and not deserving better. That’s what happened to me. I ended up with an abusive police officer. He lied to me. He told me that he had had a vasectomy. He told me he wished he could get me pregnant so he could keep me in his life forever.</p><p xss=removed>At 25 I was pregnant, destitute and all alone. I had been taken out of work at just 5 months along because of all my health issues. I had no where to turn. I hadn’t talked to my mom or step-dad for 4 years. I made the biggest mistake of my life and called them.</p><p xss=removed>They were absolutely thrilled to be having their 1st grand child. They fed me. They threw me a baby shower. They bought me everything I needed for my son. I told my step-dad that if he ever lay a finger on my son I would have him arrested.</p><p xss=removed>Maybe it was Stockholm syndrome or something but I was happy to have some type of family in my life. I had spent 4 years having no place to go on Thanksgiving or Christmas. I’ve never had many friends. I was quiet and shy and I couldn’t trust. I hoped that my parents had changed.</p><p xss=removed>They had changed to some degree. They spoiled my son. He wasn’t their responsibility so they could just enjoy him and send him home. I monitored their relationship closely over the years. There were several times that I had to step in and set my foot down. For example, I had to make sure that my step-dad didn’t drive drunk with my son in the car. I had to insist that he not make his racist comments in front of my son. Because I monitored everything so closely, I agreed to let my son spend one night a week with my parents.</p><p xss=removed>I never told my son all the horrible things my parents or his father did to me. I wanted to protect my son. I didn’t want to taint their image to him. I didn’t want to be bitter and angry around my son. I figured he would learn the truth about them on his own when he was old enough to understand.</p><p xss=removed>After working at the hospital, my body was still struggling. I decided to go back to college and earn my degree in criminal justice. I worked jobs that were easier on my body. I worked security, loss prevention, and I even did some stuff for the state police. My body gave out though at the age of 30. The physical abuse I endured was just too much and it finally caught up with me.</p><p xss=removed> </p><h3 xss=removed>6.

I cannot sit or stand for long periods of time. I suffer chronic pain. I have muscle aches, joint pain and weakness, bone pain, and nerve pain all over my body all the time. I get injections all over my body just so I can function enough to care for my son and I.</p><p xss=removed>I did not date for 15 years while raising my son as a single parent. I didn’t want to bring different men around him. I was also too busy and stressed spending all those years in family Court trying to protect us from his father. Now that I’m 42 and disabled, most men don’t find me appealing I guess.</p><p xss=removed>My son started rebelling at 16. My parents did not help. Instead they would undermine me and talk bad about me to my son every chance they got. I would try to discipline my son by taking his phone away. My parents would run out and buy him a new one. I would also try disciplining him by changing the WiFi password. He would run away to their house. The police would tell me that they couldn’t force him to come home and to file a PINS petition.</p><p xss=removed>A few months ago my son ran away for good. He lives with them now. They have turned him against me. He hates me. He does not want any chores or any rules. He will be 18 in September.</p><p xss=removed>My son does not know what abuse is. I ended the cycle of violence. When I became pregnant I started seeing a psychologist. I still see her to this day, 18 years later. She helped me tremendously to end the cycle.</p><p xss=removed>I currently have an order of protection against my son’s father. At our last court appearance, my son showed up with his father. My son and I don’t speak now. He is too involved with all of them. My heart is crushed.</p><p xss=removed>My parents and my son’s father have my son believing that I am this terrible, awful person. They call me a “professional victim.” I’m “mentally retarded.” I’m a “nut job.” I’m a “disgrace to women and mothers everywhere.” I am told to “Shut the fuck up you stupid ugly bitch.”</p><p xss=removed>Someone asked me how I keep going. It used to be my son. Now, the only thing that stops me from swallowing my entire bottle of pain pills is my cats. I promised them a “furever home.” I cannot imagine how scared they would be for strangers to come in and cage them and take them away from their comfy home.</p><p xss=removed>If you read all this God bless you. I hope this answered your questions. Specifically, I have lived on my own since I was 18. I have never depended on anyone since then. I can no longer work as my body is way too damaged and fragile. My parents were never held accountable for any of their abuse.</p><p xss=removed> </p><h3 xss=removed>7. About hope and faith…</h3><p xss=removed>I guess all my life I have wished for some kind of hero to come rescue me and take me away from this place, from them. I cannot go anywhere without great anxiety about running into one of them. I imagine this hero rescuing me and just holding me and letting me cry and telling me that’s it’s ok, that I can take a break, that I don’t have to be strong all the time. I imagine being loved for who I am and being told that I am deserving of love, that I am worthy of love. I have struggled and endured and survived abuse my whole entire life and I’ve learned that no such hero exists.</p><hr xss=removed><p xss=removed> </p><p xss=removed>All I can write is that she was very brave throughout and I hope she gets the strength to fight all the odds bravely.</p><p xss=removed>Be strong, Ann!</p> ', 'raped_by_father.jpg', '1', 'Jitendra Gautam', NULL, '2016-07-26 15:37:02'),

The company’s ‘Xiaomi Sync’ software is pre-installed to pair data from a Xiaomi smartphone, and you can unlock the laptop using a Mi Band wearable.</p><p xss=removed>The starting price is 3599 CNY, or around $540, for the 12.5-inch model with the larger, flagship model coming in at 4,999, or $750. Don’t hold your breath on an international launch, since many of Xiaomi products — particularly its first forays into new categories — are China-only affairs. What we know so far is it will go on sale in China from August 2.</p><p xss=removed>Under the hood, Xiaomi is promising an Intel Core i5 Processor with 8GB DDR4 RAM and 256GB PCIe SSD, and an expandable SSD slot. For games, there’s a dedicated NVIDIA GeForce 940MX graphics card. Size-wise, we are talking 306.9 mm x 210.9 mm x 14.8 mm with an apparent weight of 1.28 kg.</p><p xss=removed>Those specs slip a little for the smaller model, which includes an Intel Core M3 processor with integrated graphics, with 4GB RAM and 128GB in expandable SSD.</p><p xss=removed><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1359717" src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/minotebook2.jpg?w=680&h=383" alt="minotebook2" width="680" height="383" xss=removed></p><p xss=removed>As is so often the case, Apple is the standard for Xiaomi’s product comparison. The Chinese company said the Mi Notebook Air is thinner (13 percent) than its equivalent Macbook Air, and 11 percent smaller than its rival thanks to a 5.56 mm bezel.</p><div xss=removed></div><div

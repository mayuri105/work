From when I was a kid and they had "x-ray glasses" to now, downloading the latest and greatest app. The promise of productivity, convenience, or x-ray vision draws me in.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Of course, many innovations have brought tremendous boosts in what we can do, and how we can do it. Since you can now carry 10x more music than I accumulated on vinyl in the first ten years of my record buying life on a micro SD card, I''d say things have improved considerably.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But as we change and adapt some things have gone missing. Many stores have taken the opportunity to use technology to reduce the amount of staff in their shops and stores. Other businesses are dropping service levels to near zero based on a strategy that seems to be derived from data and an overwrought need to misuse it.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But what happened to fundamentals? One example, I bought a used SUV a couple of years ago. It was a late model and by no means inexpensive. Moreover, I bought it through the internet side of the dealership. A quick sale for the dealer, and with no hassle since I paid in full. In terms of processing the deal they were excellent. But did I ever get a thank you? Nope. A follow-up on how the vehicle was working out? Nope.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One small example of how you can align all the pieces of a transaction, and deliver, but fail to pick up the real bounce, which is making me feel like I matter. Gaining a customer as opposed to just making a sale. In a business as hyper competitive as car sales you think they''d be kicking out the differentiators. Nope.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While technology is great, the fundamentals are greater. The very stuff that people will glaze over and say "I know, I know" as you try to remind them of it. Well, knowing and doing aren''t the same thing. Knowledge without action is pretty worthless. You can "know" how to paint, but until you make a painting the paint is only worth what it costs by the tube. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In the end, technological advances are only valuable to the extent they serve to enhance the fundamental operation of a business. The should make the same ebb and flow of ancient commerce smoother.

People tend to gloss over it. My observation is that leading a retweet with RT is guaranteed to inhibit engagement. Also, while I could re-work the tweet/quote you are counting on me having the time and inclination to do it. The more you "set it up" the better your chances.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #181818; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #181818; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;If the quote is really good, and I don''t already have it, I''ll add it to my database.

So one night we ventured out for some food, in this case Chinese food at Ming Palace. Being a somewhat cautious person, I did some checking on TripAdvisor beforehand to see what was decent. The place in question was 4th on their list.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;As it turns out, 4th place was good enough to be pathetically mediocre. The food &nbsp;was served quickly, and it wasn''t over or under cooked. But it was devoid of any flavor. All served under the watchful eyes of the owner who never once inquired if we were enjoying, or had enjoyed, the food.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;How can that be? Well, I suppose that the standard of Eskilstuna isn''t especially high, being a town of roughly 100,000 people, it isn''t a likely spot for a top chef to hang their hat. Perhaps because of that, the restaurant had several customers who seemed to be contentedly grazing away. There isn''t enough competition to force the Ming Palace to "up their game."</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;But let''s consider it from another perspective: there is NO competition. In other words, here is a place with a facility that is already open, and is actively serving clients. They are already doing 97% of the job it will take to make the place a star. All they have to do is put a little love into the food. If it was well seasoned, they''d probably be jammed with people.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;At a minimum I''d bet a fair sum that an addition 5% effort would yield at &nbsp;least a 20% increase in business. But I suspect it won''t happen. They are probably puttering along OK, paying their bills and taking some time off every year. Business is good, or at least good enough. Right? Wrong.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;For now, the owners are safe. The little eco-system of this Swedish town is allowing them to survive on what they are doing. But what if one of their competitors decides to bring their "A" game? All of a sudden they might be having very little business and struggling to survive. They might even be forced to close.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Such is the danger in playing the "safe" game of good enough. It provides an elusive veneer of comfort. They might be doing a little less business than before, but they can cut expenses, turn the heat down a bit. Slowly strangling a business that could thrive if someone would just look at it with a fresh set of eyes.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Don''t be tempted to play the game of good enough. Bring your best game every day. Don''t settle for being a little better than others. If the competition is poor, play hard anyhow. You never know when someone will show up ready to compete, so you need to be at your best.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Don''t be lulled into complacency; good enough never is.&nbsp;</span><br /><br />&nbsp; ', '', '', 1, 1, 0, 'good-enough-never-is'),

The old way made sense. The printer did its best to sort you out with what it had "on-hand". Not any more.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;For those who may be unfamiliar with the economics of the printer business, it is a low profit business on printers but high profit on cartridges. Thus the new "engineering" to force additional cartridge purchases. It''s a sort of document extortion.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;This blog is part love letter to an inventor, or printer executive that wants to take over the industry. People want a printer that prints, even when the inks a bit low. Ideally that''ll be a very sporadic condition. I''m virtually certain you can charge more, way more, for a printer that screams "I''ll be ready when you need me!"&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the interim, I managed to unearth an old laser printer from the closet.

Don''t. Do NOT do it.&nbsp;</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually, you will have to hire people, but try to put it off as long as possible. While you might think there is an element of sadism involved on my part there are reasons...</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;First, you need to be able to present someone with a clearly&nbsp;delineated&nbsp;job. That''s very hard to do in the beginning. In a start-up, many days end in a blur. But patterns eventually emerge in your work wherein you could explain a list of items to another person, you have the beginning of a job for someone. It takes some time.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Second, by doing things yourself in the beginning you gain a massive amount of knowledge. That helps in the operation of any business and it also gives you valuable empathy for the person you''ll eventually have doing those tasks for the business.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Third, hiring is: easy in, hard out. Searching for your first "employee" is kind of&nbsp;exhilarating. You meet lot''s&nbsp;of eager people ready to make a difference. Then you pick someone. But sometimes you blow it. You pick the wrong person. If hiring is fun, firing is the opposite. Firing people is a major buzz killer. The longer you wait, the better&nbsp;delineated&nbsp;the job will be, and the greater the&nbsp;chance for success in hiring.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Fourth, hiring people costs money. Unless you have been massively funded or were born into big money, you''ll find cash has a quick evaporation rate. Employees are helpful, but they are also expensive. Be sure you are absolutely clear on how you''re going to specifically benefit from having this person. Have enough clarity to explain the hiring to an investor, even if you have none.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;With some luck, you''ll grow and clear these hurdles. You''ll hire lot''s and lot''s of people and live happily ever after. But applying this logic to each position will keep you lean and focused.

One in Stockholm, and the other in Florida. One sold, the other didn''t. This is a tale of scale.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; To many people the image of Sweden is probably of a chilly place with somewhat grumpy socialists marching across the frozen landscape. Florida by contrast is a wonderland of palm trees and happiness. But I digress...</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; When I contacted my broker in Sweden, he came by, we discussed the market conditions (a bit&nbsp;mediocre&nbsp;in 2010) and signed an agreement. Since I was on the road a bit we arranged for the house to be shown in my absence.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In Florida, I also contacted a broker I knew and arranged for the house to be listed. Market conditions were a bit better in 2012, so I was&nbsp;optimistic&nbsp;about the prospects for the house. This house was also being sold with me being out of town.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Two houses, both in desirable settings, were being sold in roughly the same manner, at least from my perspective as the seller.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Where things became very very different was in the approach of the broker.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;My broker in Stockholm takes very few houses to sell. But they ALL get sold. He puts his time and effort into it, and the listings are exclusive to him.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;He took a&nbsp;decidedly average house in a nice suburb and had it sold well above our expected final price&nbsp;within a matter of a few weeks.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; Why? Because he is focused on very few things professionally. He takes in listings which he is confident he can sell, and then puts his efforts into making that happen. In this case he even, at his own expense, detailed the property.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;By contrast, the broker in Florida has many many listings, all in the MLS. He''s a good, hard-working guy, but he''s focusing on running his business, rather than the individual listings his firm has.. His money is in having enough inventory that some houses move and they take a cut. He is, in a word, scaling.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In fairness, they did put some effort into it. But the focus of the business is too spread out. The effort to market the house was just not sufficient. It sat and sat, until the market just sort of forgot about it and I had it removed from the market after several months.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The moral of the story, is that while scale might sound very appealing, it doesn''t work for all businesses. For me as a client, I was much better looked after by my broker in Sweden.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Client''s don''t care about your market share, or your reach. The internet reaches everyone. We want to be looked after. In a business involving such an intrusive process as selling a home, being another number feels lousy. Having the home not sell, worse.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;I even wonder if scales works for the big broker. The smaller operation is less visible, but also less stressful, highly profitable (virtually no overhead) and he has the luxury of turning away business. The larger operation is a machine with a lot of moving parts. All of which must be kept working for the business to survive.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In businesses that are totally data driven, with wafer thin margins, scale is a necessity.

The two airlines have somewhat different business models with Ryanair being almost completely al la carte. But that hardly excuses the larceny on their website.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;This leads to my more fundamental question, have we become so jaded by the web that we are now willing to excuse what would have previously been inexcusable behavior?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; Imagine if the behavior of a physical store was the same as their internet site. What if a clerk walked around putting things into your shopping cart based on what you had already selected? Or perhaps added insurance on durable goods without asking first? My suspicion is that you''d be outraged. On the internet, we just seem to accept it. Odd.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover in the "life as the Internet" concept, if the cashier rang up your purchase (including the "staff suggested" items) you are almost incapacitated in your ability to return the purchased goods. Would you stand for the same behavior in a live situation as you do in a web situation? If not, why not? Aren''t the situations just different implementations of the same transaction?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Has the web desensitized us to bad behavior? It certainly seems the rules have changed, and for now, many businesses seem to be getting in touch with their inner sociopath. That''s reprehensible, but I am even more disgusted at the&nbsp;bleating&nbsp;acquiescence&nbsp;of the masses.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;From now on, try to follow a simple rule: If you wouldn''t tolerate behavior from a bricks and mortar merchant, don''t tolerate it on the Internet.

As usual my mind was wandering &nbsp;It came to a sudden halt on the idea of writing a book. The thought of sharing the things that I learned along the way was interesting to me. While I had read and enjoyed many business books in the past, I wanted to do something different.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span>  <br /><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;As I thought about it, the idea was increasingly appealing. However, I felt many "success" books gave you a bunch of information that, while valuable, was not easily remembered.

An idea was born.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Later that day I sat in my office and wrote out the following outline:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white;">ABC - Always Be Committed &nbsp;</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">DEF - Don''t Ever Forget (to say thank you)</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">GHI - Getting Highly Inspired</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">JKL - Just Keep Looking</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">MNO - Make Notes and Observations</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">PQR - Pursue Quantitative Results</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">STU - Start Teaching and Understanding</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">VWX - Value with X-factor</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">YZ - Yellow Zebra</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;While the book took over ten years for me to get around to writing, editing and finishing, the alphabetic outline survived.

A friend and I were sitting at the bar waiting for a table, as Joe''s doesn''t take reservations. So we chatted at the noisy bar and had a couple of drinks.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; After a while the wait seemed to be a bit too long, even for Joe''s which can be a little slow in getting around to seating you. Aside from a few serious Miami players, everybody waits, so it''s just part of going there. That said, I decided to ask the maitre d'' for an estimate of when our table would be ready.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Once I managed to break through the throngs of people I got the maitre d''s attention and we located my name on the list. Upon which he informed me, "I called your name about ten minutes ago." &nbsp;Having no reason to doubt him, I said, "Oh, well I guess I didn''t hear you. Do we have to start over? What''s the process?" While I didn''t want to sit another ninety minutes, there was no point being pushy with someone who deals with pushy people in 15 second intervals.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;He looked at me for a second, and then said, "just stand over there" and motioned to the side of the vestibule. We did as instructed. Within seconds we were whisked away by "Bones" who is the a long-time fixture at Joe''s. He took us to a nice table, handed us menus, thanked us and departed. The perusal of the menus began.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Within a minute or two our waiter arrived and asked about our drink order. We asked for a couple glasses of white wine as well as some water. A few minutes later the waiter returned with a bottle of white wine. I mentioned we had just wanted a couple of glasses. He then explained that the wine had been sent to us by the maitre d. I was floored. I couldn''t imagine why.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;After inquiring, Bones returned and explained, "We have people miss the call for their table all the time, and it ends up with an argument and them making a fuss. You were so calm and respectful, we just wanted to say thank you." Wow! It still floors me. What an impression.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Here it is, over ten years later, with over thirty years of patronizing the restaurant and that''s still my defining moment at Joe''s.

But it is because they have that humanity that the restaurant continues to be "the place" to for anniversaries and birthdays in Miami. Your customers aren''t units, they''re people.

Not a wildly different model from Monster.com or other career sites today.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was just one problem. In 1985, there weren''t a whole lot of people thinking about databases, there was no Monster.com to compare myself to, and in general few people understood what I was talking about. Thus the innovation dilemma. Great to have a new idea, but people don''t generally buy things that they don''t understand.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Fast forward a year, I was out of money and patience (not that either were especially abundant previously) and simply folded up my tent and went on to other things. But the lesson of those days did remain. When you invent or present the world with a new idea, you better be able to very simply explain the concept, because people aren''t going to hang around for a class on the subject.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The easiest explanations are those that allow the audience to reference an existing idea. If, for instance, I mentioned that I had an amazing new type of donut, you''d have an image and&nbsp;usefulness&nbsp;in&nbsp;your mind already. It might not be exactly what I was doing, but it would likely be close. But if I said I had a reverse twisting buzznut to help with your laundry, you''d be&nbsp;understandably&nbsp;in need&nbsp;of further information.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The reverse twisting buzznut might be awesome and filled with benefits. But until the potential buyers understand the product&nbsp;sufficiently&nbsp;to become "actual" buyers your cash is going out the window.&nbsp;The idea will only make it when someone emerges with the resources and skills to get the message out effectively.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; If you happen to be an innovator, you must also be a&nbsp;communicator, or have access to one.

He held on to this passion into the final years of his life. Moreover, he wasn''t just passionate about the chase, he truly wanted to catch them. It consumed him to even see a squirrel in our yard. He demanded to be released to pursue his quarry.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In fourteen years of diligent pursuit of squirrels, never giving less than his absolute all, he caught exactly zero squirrels. So much for persistence and patience. On their own, those two attributes have great potential; for comedy. To be effective they must be tied to intelligence. In that regard, Patches was sadly lacking. A lovely dog, but dumber than a bag of hammers.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; If you want your persistence and patience to pay off, you need to add a nice healthy dose of thinking to interpret the feedback you get from your efforts.

Keep it simple, measurable, and in spite of the "soar with eagles" chatter, within reasonable grasp. Complexity messes up your thinking, measurement is essential, and by finding some things you can get done with a modest effort, you can always reset your target with the confidence gained from round one.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Find a way to give your goals some synergy. Losing weight? How about a 5k run as another goal? The training will help with your other goal of losing weight. Losing weight will make running easier. Or if you want to read more, then add joining a book club. You get the idea.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Write it down! Commit it to a friend! - Everyone says this. Why? Because it works. Writing it down makes you internalize it. It''s harder to forget. If you put it somewhere (like your calendar) it will keep staring you in the face. Good. Tell a friend too. They can also stare you in the face! If you have someone who will give you a friendly nudge, take advantage of it. Big help.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; 4. &nbsp;Don''t be too rigid. Things go wrong. Adjust and move on. Rigid thinking is what puts goals on the shelf for another year. Relax a bit and if something goes wrong, dust yourself off, adjust and keep plodding along. You''ll make it!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;5. Whatever you do - this is critical. Have fun. The more fun your goals are to reach, and the more fun you inject into the mindset, the more likely you''ll make it happen. Fun: have it!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Get your PEN and PAPER.

LISTEN.', '&nbsp; <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When I was a boy, I used to cut grass in the summers to make extra money. One of my clients was my father. On a pretty routine basis I''d cut the grass (what I thought I was hired to do) only to have my father dissect the job with his engineering mindset (I imagined him with a T-square&nbsp;examining&nbsp;the&nbsp;edges). In short, he was disappointed, and I was annoyed.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;A classic case of poor agreement on expectations. To me "cut the grass" meant running the mower over the yard to reduce the general height of the lawn. To my father "cut the grass" meant running the mower over the yard until it looked like a putting green. Nobody was right or wrong. Just badly matched ideas of the job in question.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;I hadn''t listened well, and he''d fallen short in explaining. Thus, the problem.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;That listening could fail so completely in such a rudimentary task is illustrative of the problems we all encounter in trying to foster meaningful clear communication. My use of lawn cutting is deliberate; many of our daily communications are on much more complex topics.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;This could be a complete book (and perhaps that''s a thought) so let me outline a few suggestions:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;1) Listening requires more than remaining quiet. If you aren''t positive you understand, even by a whisper of a hint, ask for clarification.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;2) The more specific the communication, the less room for misunderstanding. Over- communicating is faster than reworking. (Even when lawn cutting!)</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;3) Listening includes CULTURE. &nbsp;Active listening is a CULTURE. A valuable one at that.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;4) Listening includes&nbsp;demonstrating</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;your comprehension by using some of what you hear in your plans. Even if the information is marginal, the payback for using a suggestion is in opening the pipeline for future information and suggestions.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; 5) Be sure you are truly open to ideas and comments. When people are busy calibrating their message to&nbsp;accommodate&nbsp;your "demanding personality", you may lose the point.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; 6) Remember, often the most important message is the one left unspoken.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the end, my father and I sorted things out. Once I understood clearly what he wanted, I increased my price 250%. After an initial hesitation he accepted. I got more spending money, and he got his putting green.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Listening is a profitable, sanity preserving, exercise that everyone should actively practice on a daily basis. Of course, listening isn''t mandatory, but neither is success.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">PS - Tip of the hat to Tom Peters for getting me fired up about this.

Except when they''re not.', '<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Back when I was running Omega I had a brilliant idea. If we offered recorded statements on our investigations, we''d pick up a nice chuck of extra revenue and profit on many of the assignments we got. I did my best "idiots math". If we only get assignments on 20% of the cases, it will be so awesome, because 20% x the number of investigations x the $$$ for each statement is BIG MONEY. Duhhh.&nbsp;</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In fairness (to me of course) this was a line of business related to what we did (investigations) and would be pretty easy to sell to our clients. The problem was pretty simple. We sucked at doing recorded statements. Add to that a complete lack of a coherent training program, as well as no real software tools to monitor quality, and you have a classic business screw up.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously we should have had all those pieces in place BEFORE we launched. But we were blinded by overconfidence and seduced by the money. Everyone, including some very smart people (not me) were all on board for this idea. In the heat of the moment (or the meeting) it''s easy to let enthusiasm get the better of you. People truly assume someone is thinking about the downside, unless nobody is, which can easily happen.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;A secondary screw up is the attention this diverted from what we were already expert in, surveillance. We could crank out surveillance. We had rapid quality recruiting, awesome training, great investigators, superb software. We had it all. Ramp up the demand for it, and we''d meet it.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;If we''d devoted our time to selling more of what we were good at, we would not have failed. We''d have made an almost certain increase in both sales and profits. So why didn''t we?&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;We were looking for adventure. Excitement. The thought of simply expanding our existing offerings was&nbsp;subconsciously&nbsp;boring. So boring that it wasn''t discussed. Conversely the new business was so&nbsp;exciting, we assumed our competence would extend through osmosis to this new line of work. WRONG.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;From small businesses to large businesses this situation is common. People selling B2B decide consumers would be such better clients...or vice versa. The ease with which we drift from our circle of competence is frightening. You might ask why I didn''t know better. I thought I did. Really. I wasn''t THAT guy.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The lesson to me is very clear. Stick with what you know until sticking is stupid. Tread into new waters with the absolute greatest trepidation. There will be opportunities, and they should be taken advantage of, but put someone in charge of figuring out why you''re wrong. Really. Make it someone''s assignment to shoot a torpedo in any new idea you have.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;While I agree with, and frequently post quotes about, the thinking that it is trying things and making mistakes that lead us to grow, it''s good to balance that with some deliberation and caution. There is an&nbsp;exhilaration&nbsp;of the "new" that is very seductive. So it''s important to remember: Ideas&nbsp;are great.

Some folks will disagree with my suggestions, but tough tiddliwinks.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; How to set goals, the quick version:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Keep it simple, measurable, and in spite of the "soar with eagles" chatter, within reasonable grasp. Complexity messes up your thinking, measurement is essential, and by finding some things you can get done with a modest effort, you can always reset your target with the confidence gained from round one.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Find a way to give your goals some synergy. Losing weight? How about a 5k run as another goal? The training will help with your other goal of losing weight. Losing weight will make running easier. Or if you want to read more, then add joining a book club. You get the idea.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Write it down! Commit it to a friend! - Everyone says this. Why? Because it works. Writing it down makes you internalize it. It''s harder to forget. If you put it somewhere (like your calendar) it will keep staring you in the face. Good. Tell a friend too. They can also stare you in the face! If you have someone who will give you a friendly nudge, take advantage of it. Big help.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; 4. &nbsp;Don''t be too rigid. Things go wrong. Adjust and move on. Rigid thinking is what puts goals on the shelf for another year. Relax a bit and if something goes wrong, dust yourself off, adjust and keep plodding along. You''ll make it!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;5. Whatever you do - this is critical. Have fun. The more fun your goals are to reach, and the more fun you inject into the mindset, the more likely you''ll make it happen.

The hashtags are for fun and to break things up a bit. The reason to use shorthand is simple math. With only 140 characters it is important to use as few as possible. I''d rather explain and make sure I have room to mention EVERYONE.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The quantity of the tweets is dictated by the amount of people who have either retweeted or responded to something. I thank everyone since it would be impractical to examine the nature of every exchange. Occasionally someone doesn''t recall making a mention, but I take the history directly from Twitter, so it is most likely a lapse in memory.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The second reason there are so many is that I try not to them every day, though that is getting harder as things get busier. There are limits on the number of tweets per day etc and I have to follow the rules of Twitter. I have worked to make them appear fairly quickly, and then finish. Always tweeking the tweets. :-)</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The meaning is simple.

Don''t value it by the price, value it by the utility.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">2) As Cameron Morrissey (@ManagersDiary)&nbsp;coincidentally&nbsp;wrote in his recent blog entry #200, (<span style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Celebrate Milestones -&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0084b4;"><span class="tco-ellipsis" style="background-color: whitesmoke; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></span><a class="twitter-timeline-link" data-expanded-url="http://dld.bz/c6cBm" dir="ltr" href="http://t.co/cdqQdFDEpH" rel="nofollow" style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #0084b4; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;" target="_blank" title="http://dld.bz/c6cBm"><span class="invisible" style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #0084b4; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; white-space: pre-wrap;">http://</span><span class="js-display-url" style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #0084b4; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;">dld.bz/c6cBm</span><span style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #0084b4; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span class="invisible" style="background-color: whitesmoke; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; line-height: 0; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></span><span class="tco-ellipsis" style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #0084b4; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span class="invisible" style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0;">&nbsp;</span></span></a>)&nbsp;<u>milestones matter.</u> Sure, Tom is a remarkably accomplished and successful guy. Does that diminish his desire for recognition? I haven''t asked, but I rather doubt it. If success alone was enough for most, there wouldn''t be so many multi-gazillionaires still working and so many top athletes stretching their careers.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Let''s sound the trumpets as he crosses the line! Three cheers. You''d want the same.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">3) I also did it because I like Tom and I''m grateful to be&nbsp;acquainted&nbsp;with him. He gives a tremendous&nbsp;amount of himself on his Twitter account. Moreover, he is the kind of person that everyone should hope is advising them or their employer. He cares about people and it radiates through virtually everything he talks about. In a world of self-aggrandizing dolts, Tom shines through as a genuinely nice fellow who happens to be very knowledgeable about leadership.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">4) The final reason, which is something obvious: I did it because I felt like it. If it makes him smile, then my mission is accomplished.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Thank you Tom. &nbsp;For sharing your thoughts and insights on a regular basis on Twitter. For sidestepping the trolls, and steadfastly holding down your end of every argument. You could have the campfire all to yourself, but you open it up frequently for anyone to pop by for and enjoy some heady conversation.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Congratulations on cresting the 100,000 follower mark.

What are you getting at?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Great question! Nobody has asked me directly, but I do get some interesting comments, challenges etc. As a result I''d like to clarify my "goal" and provide some clarity about the quotes and my tweets:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;1) The primary purpose of my selections and compositions is to make you think. What you do with those thoughts is entirely up to you.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; 2) While I am glad to sometimes briefly discuss a quote or whatever, I''m not going to enter a debate with you about a tweet. If you don''t like a particular quote or tweet, there are +/- 72 per day. You''ll probably find others you''ll enjoy. The why is very very simple: The forum isn''t ideal for debate and a bit unfair to people who stop by for content, and more importantly, you can deconstruct just about anything composed in 140 characters. I don''t agree with everything I tweet, so why should you?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;3) With regard to tweeting things I don''t agree with. Sometimes we are informed by consent, other times by dissent. Finding a place between the two creates a sort of imaginary set of bookends for an opinion. If nothing else, the idea of being thought provoking allows for differing sets of opinion.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;They are there to provoke thought.

I love putting it on Twitter. It always gets positive feedback. But that is actually rather ironic. If so many people love that quote, then why are such gargantuan sums spend on schooling?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In a similar sense, parent after parent brags about how their child does in school. As I parent, I too feel some of the glow from a "good grade". Some is a simple matter of wanting to let my kids know that I appreciate the effort they make. But I question how important the grade is, what meaning it actually holds. Moreover, I wonder how much more meaningless it becomes when put into a global schematic.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;As someone who is "successful" I look back at my own schooling and see how incredibly unprepared my schools and teachers were for me. I did well in school at times, but was pretty much always a discipline problem. Mostly because I refused to accept some lessons as true. I wasn''t content to just digest and regurgitate the information they fed to me. I wanted some answers. They didn''t like that, they didn''t like that at all.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;A dramatic example occurred in the seventh grade. Having been asked to solve an algebra problem I went up to the chalkboard and began scrawling out my answer. "No, no, no" my teacher screamed. Bewildered I looked over to her. "You have to show ALL YOUR WORK." she continued. Right about this time my blood headed to an immediate boil. I stormed over to my desk and grabbed my things. I then walked back to the front of the class and threw my books onto her desk. "If your way is so perfect then do it yourself" I shouted. I then proceeded to walk out of the class, and out the front door of the school, and continued walking until I was home roughly four miles away.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;A rash decision? Maybe, but I don''t regret it. She was wrong to publicly humiliate me for not following "her" method to precision. It was also pretty obvious from the way I wrote the equation that I had used logical thinking to arrive at the answer. Her goal wasn''t that I simply know the math. Her goal included my submission to her methodology. As you may have noticed, submission isn''t my strong suit.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem, from my vantage point, is the teacher''s desire to make me conform to her methodology. She valued compliance over competence. It doesn''t matter why. Schooling should create thinkers, not fleshy calculators. The desire for compliance makes children into pliable robots who indirectly learn to keep their head down, and put out what is asked. No more, no less.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;"<span style="background-color: white;">Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel." - Socrates</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Socrates knew something about educating people.

So as a kid, I concocted a motivational game to get myself home on time.  I would imagine a huge, ugly monster chasing me through the streets of Akron, Ohio.   I''ll never forget that adrenalin-propelled rush of nearly flying over the pavement, feeling the monster''s hot, rancid breath (I think it may actually have been the tire factories) while sprinting just ahead of his moldy grasp.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Over the years, my monster has provided the motivation I''ve needed not only to succeed, but to thrive in the business world.

The hairy beast chased me through college and graduate school, and finally into entrepreneurship.  And I''m still running, but now for fitness; and not in Akron, but St. Petersburg, Florida.   </span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;When I decided to start my own private-investigation firm in 1996, the monster breathed the specter of poverty.  My new wife and I were living in a small apartment, whose rent, like everything else in our lives at the time, was paid by credit card.  The monster helped me chase after business just to make sure we could eat and keep gas in the car and a roof over our heads.  </span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;He also spewed the foul odor of self-doubt.  I often lay awake at night wondering how a guy like me could possibly presume to run a business, especially against older, wiser (I thought!), and more experienced competition.   </span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;But as I ran faster to escape the monster''s clutches (he now sported a cheap, private-eye trench coat), I found myself learning a lot about how business operates.  One particularly revealing lesson was that my "competition" was really only a little more gifted than my monster.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; For the most part, private investigators were what they always had been - retired police officers, special investigative unit (SIU) guys, or insurance adjustors.  They often worked alone, used manual processes, and for sales collateral brandished their business cards.  </span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;So while they clung to their Sam Spade model (and, for the most part, still do), I decided to innovate.  While they snoozed between cases (feet up on the desk, of course), I learned about my marketplace - the claims and risk professionals who were purchasing investigative services.   With the monster ever in the wings, I talked to people, read the trade journals, and found out what they really needed from an investigator.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then I decided that when fighting monsters, there is strength in numbers.  So I took on partners, then employees.  Every year, university criminal-justice programs were turning out legions of bright, energetic graduates, hungry for their first job and looking to learn the ways of surveillance.  Why not hire them, pay them a decent salary, and teach them the ropes?</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;And in order to keep my new employees working, why not find innovative ways of generating more business - by using what I had learned about our market, exhibiting at trade shows, producing sales literature that worked, by advertising, and by constantly generating new ideas for promoting the business?  And why not self-publish a helpful booklet for clients about how surveillance works?</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; We also made a commitment to using the hottest technology to run the business.  (The monster was using none.)  We outfitted our field investigators with the latest in video and wireless technology, trained them in its most efficient use, and sent them forth to generate revenue.   </span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;But the real coup d''etat was the Internet.  Our business is surveillance, which generally means video tapes accompanied by written reports.

Perhaps a better way to phrase it, they didn''t prevent me from practicing with them. That said, I was decent enough, and was fast enough to stay out of their way. It was a point of pride with me that I was there, and I trained HARD!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;You might think I would have developed a bit of insight after having to learn how to swim properly at the age of 23. Previously, I couldn''t even get my face in the water. But a few sessions with a friend that had a swimming background put me on the path to swimming quasi-normally.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;One week we "hosted" the University of Miami swim team, as their pool was being renovated. This was a great opportunity as UM had some potential Olympians on their team. Swimming next to them was going to be a treat. A chance to measure oneself against greatness. Well, after a brief comparison I was ready to drop the idea of measuring anything.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The first time I set off next to one of the team, I was dumbfounded. Was the guy being pulled by a jet ski? I redoubled my effort. This made me marginally faster, and massively exhausted. He, on the other hand, appeared to be having a nice leisurely dip. ARRGGGHH. My only hope was to be less embarrassed over a short distance. So much for training HARD.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Had I been wasting my time? No, I had gotten much better than before, and the training had made a difference. But, if my goal was to diminish the gap between myself and the UM swimmers, I knew pretty much instantly that MORE TRAINING was NOT the answer.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;This leads me to my point. Effort is great. But effort without great technique can be wasteful, and potentially damaging. Too often the standard motivational cry is to TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT. Good luck with that. My experience is that while clearly motivation is important, as you approach higher levels of competition, <u>how you try</u> is likely more important than <u>how hard you try</u>.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;When you want approach the top of a sport or field of endeavor, pretty much everybody is motivated. In a swim competition you need only look around the pool to see that everyone is very fit. Past that point the biggest differences are down to technique.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;To improve myself I solicited a member of the UM team to train me. While I never got anything close to good enough to compete with them, I made amazing progress in improving my own times. To do this, I had to take a step back and evaluate my approach. By being objective, I knew I was in very good condition, had an excellent diet, and was putting forth an tremendous effort. Trying harder would have been pointless.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Thus, when I say "Don''t Waste Your Effort" I mean it literally. Put forth an effort, absolutely. But be sure you are putting forth the right effort. In a race, nobody cares about your horsepower, they care about your speed. By putting your effort to translating horsepower to output, you won''t waste your effort. You''ll get more out of doing less.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;That''s the right way to apply effort.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />', '', '', 1, 1, 1, 'dont-waste-your-effortreally-dont'),

Thanks!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Thinking about the post, and relating it to my own experience I came away with an example which reinforces his message, and to some degree expands on part of it.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The major point or critique is a reflection about people''s desire to sample rather than savor things, so they can race off to the next thing. Or conversely, having gathered some information about it, flutter away without really trying it at all. There is a lot of misplaced risk aversion encased in this phenomena.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;With deference to people''s need to maximize their "time", I think it is pretty good to have some experiences that suck. If you are really out there living every now and then you''re going to have a bad experience. Awesome!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;What? Crap experiences. Delete, Esc, Ctrl-Alt-Del. Help!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Yep, you need to have some sub par experiences, or if you are massively anal about your time, settle for something distinctly average. These are the palate cleansers that allow you to discern the flavor of your next course, of that next grand experience. And usually, bad experiences end up being great memories.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;My wife and I were traveling with my three kids (11 year old triplets at the time) through Jordan. We flew into Amman, and then headed south through the desert toward the Dead Sea and a small city called Kerak. Being guilty myself of trying to endlessly hedge my bets with research, I had found&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;accommodation in the Lonely Planet Guide at the&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; line-height: 1.3em;">Cairwan Hotel. When we arrived, it didn''t look too promising, but I thought, let''s do it! My enthusiasm was short-lived.</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Wow! There was an apparent rat infestation, as evidenced by some amatuer scatology. The beds were probably comfortable when the three wise men stopped by a few years back. The decor was other worldly. In an effort to ensure we would get the full effect, there was a wedding going on in the hotel bar during the night of our stay. Mayhem ensued. In short, it was really really BAD.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;My kids were nearly as aghast as I, having stayed in their share of comfortable surroundings. But this place ended up being the ice water to before our return to the sauna. Our next stop was a two-story, three bedroom suite at the Movenpick Hotel in Aqaba on the Red Sea.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; The contrast was to be savored. Every detail was richly magnified. I''m sure I would have enjoyed it without the "bad experience", but the bad hotel served as a framing experience for the good one.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; We have repeated this experience somewhat by having deliberately reduced our travels to allow for some breathing, for some normal life. Without that, the experiences fold together like food in a blender. I might know it''s there, and I can taste it, but the flavors overwhelm each other. Thus, the experiences are diminished.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no short cut to enhancing experience. When you have a bad experience, or a bland one to give it context, you come away with much more. Whether it is a lesson, a book, a course, a hotel stay or a meal. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;So, don''t try to live life as a series of straight lines always seeking the shortest route. Meander, let some things go wrong. Give yourself the benefit of context. It will sharpen your mind, and separate&nbsp;events into discrete, more pleasing occurrences.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In short, context gives you the ability to see just how incredible life is.

Hello!', '<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;As Cory Doctorow said, "You can''t monetize obscurity." In other words - The unnoticed are uncompensated. Enter the Yellow Zebra.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; Much of our lives we are encouraged to blend in, to be compliant. From our school days, into the entry to the workforce we get bombarded with the message to obey, and comply. Whole industries ride upon this wave. Our allegiance to brands that identify us as belonging to a certain group, or of being of a certain status. But blending in is dangerous. If you are hidden, how will anyone find you?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; We need to stand out. How? Pretty simple. Just be yourself. Though I imagine this is not as easy as it sounds. We are so programmed to behave in a certain way, we may have lost ourselves in the flood of messages to blend in, and join the party of sameness.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; But the benefits are so great, that we must work to be ourselves. To take a stand on something we believe in, to dare to occasionally piss a few people off. It is actually an old rule of advertising, that an ad that offends no one, effects no one. You need to be identifiable. You need to be a Yellow Zebra.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Yellow Zebra''s get noticed, they stand out. They won''t be ignored. People have opinions about them. Some people don''t like them. But in the end, they are remembered and rewarded.,&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;At Omega Insurance Services, my old company, we were the "in your face" company. If anything we errored to the side of excess. You would get mail from us, e-mail from us, we''d call you. We took had the mantra of Donkey in Shrek "pick me, pick me!" &nbsp;before the movie ever appeared. Since we made the Inc. 500 twice I''d say it worked pretty well. But we did have people occasionally say that we that were annoying. If that''s the cost of doubling revenue year after year, isn''t it worth it? Doesn''t that make being a Yellow Zebra attractive?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, that''s right. If you are truly yourself, and willing to express some of your truly unique qualities, it will pay off. It can be so counter-intuitive that people have trouble with it. &nbsp;Thinking that they won''t get through &nbsp;a job interview that way. So WHAT? If you have to be phony to get a job, perhaps it isn''t the right job for you. Wouldn''t it be better to work someplace where everyday you could be yourself? To get up everyday excited about working in an accepting uplifting environment. Can you actually imagine being a Yellow Zebra without smiling?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;If you have a business and want to have a special culture, let it be a Yellow Zebra culture. By letting people be themselves the results are astounding. You essentially develop a competitive advantage cost free by embracing that which is unique in people. Go crazy, have fun. There is another reward - fun!&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; The rewards for being a Yellow Zebra include both financial and spiritual. To give value to others, you have to begin by valuing yourself. This is the essence of being a Yellow Zebra, to identify that which makes you unique. Your personal differentiators.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Don''t wait, don''t delay.

I was nervous as hell. Heart palpitations, hand wringing, you name the nervous tick, I was on top of it! It got so bad, I called my doctor and explained that I was probably dying of a heart attack. He was not persuaded, and told me to calm down. Ha! If it would have been that easy, I''d have done it from the start. OK, I guess I was being slightly hysterical.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As evidenced by this and other posts, I made it. But in spite of the work and effort that went into growing Omega Insurance Services, it all seemed unreal. Less than seven years before I was designing my logo in Word while I made sales calls from the kitchen table off a rental apartment. So this day was truly dreamlike, with me mentally waiting for the alarm to go off.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously, that did not happen. We convened in a boardroom, in an atmosphere of absolute levity, and signed the final documents. The "transfers" were made into my accounts. Wow. While a myriad of things led to that moment, that was the finish line. The moment when everything actually changed. A bizarre mix of elation, sadness, exhaustion and a burst of energy seemed to inhabit my body. All the while I continued making all the appropriate noises, "great to be on board, and "this is going to be awesome" (it was already pretty awesome). Poker face central.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately I was saved by a party we were throwing. Nobody, outside a few key people, knew what was happening, a party seemed a good way to "cushion the shock".It did, in part, do exactly that.<br /><br />&nbsp; Which brings us to the impending 10th Anniversary, and the "virtual" party we''ll be throwing to mark the occasion. And in the spirit of open disclosure, there is a major book promotion for "Alphabet Success" at the heart of the festivities.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The questions most of you have been waiting for are: 1) What are you giving away? 2) What are the prizes? and 3) What are the contests?<br /><br />1) We are giving away free copies of my new Kindle book, Alphabet Success from 12 midnight Pacific Time to 12 midnight Pacific Time on September 10th, 2013.<br /><br />2) The prizes include: 20 - $25.00 Amazon.com gift certificates, and $1,500 in cash prizes. That leads us to our final answer...<br /><br />3) I''m not saying. The day of the event we''ll be interacting with people on Twitter (@alphabetsuccess) and LinkedIn. Primarily the former. It will be a little like a radio show. We''ll make an announcement, and something will be happening that you need to respond to in real time. For example (a good one, wink wink) you might need to be the 8th person to retweet a given Tweet or comment on a LinkedIn message. But there are plenty of other methods that will be employed to give out cash and prizes, but we''re not saying until the day of the event. For the purpose of clarity:<br /><br />The contests will be conducted on September 10th, 2013. With the exception of one contest for which the winner will be decided later. The times will include a bit of September 10th around the world, since I have followers in pretty much every time zone. I''m going to try to online for as long as Red Bull and adrenaline will keep me in the game, but we may hit some down time due to my human form.<br /><br />Will it be fun? Yes &nbsp;Do you need to buy anything to win? Absolutely not!<br /><br />For more information, please contact me at tim@alphabetsuccess.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>', '', '', 1, 1, 0, 'the-10th-anniversary-of-my-financial-freedom-looms-blowout-free-prizes-contests-'),

Well, you get the idea.', '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;Almost ten years ago, on September 10, 2003, I sold Omega Insurance Services, a little less than seven years after we started doing business, and to say my life was changed would be a massive understatement. To be 42 and know you will never <u>need</u> to work again, is a pretty delightful feeling. In essence, I was free. Not in an insane Bill Gates sort of way, but plenty free for me.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So, with the tenth anniversary of the event coming up, I decided to mark the day with another Alphabet Success giveaway. A way of celebrating my freedom over the last ten years by giving you a tool to help you get your freedom, or if you already have it, keep it.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />&nbsp; If you don''t already know, Alphabet Success is a wonderfully short, very readable Kindle book available on Amazon.com. You can download and read it on any tablet, some phones, and obviously a Kindle.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>What is the book about?</b></i> It is a distillation of the elements I think were most critical in my success as a business person as well as my success in other areas of my life. There are people who talk about the life they dream of having, and then there are those who go out and make it happen. If you want to be in the latter category, reading the book would be a very good idea.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<i><b>What secrets are in the book?</b></i> None. Zero. Zip. Nada. You probably already know everything I will tell you in the book. However, you aren''t using it on a daily basis to effect change in your life. Just like having a garage full of tools doesn''t make you a mechanic, having the tools to succeed isn''t enough to make you successful. You have to use the tools and master them.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>Will the book make me successful?</i></b> If you let it. There is no plane ticket to success. There is no little bit of magic that will pop you into the life you want. There is a set of tools, and then a fair bit of work to be done. But it can be fun, joyful and the ride can be an absolutely amazingly blissful experience.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Isn''t this just common sense? Yes. But with that in mind I will leave you with two quotes from two people far more successful and well known than me:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<i><b>There is nothing more uncommon than common sense.</b></i> - Frank Lloyd Wright</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ededed;"><i><b>There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.</b></i> - Warren Buffett</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;September 10th, 2013 from 12:00 to 12:00 Pacific Standard Time.

(55, 'Tim Fargo''s Blog', '2013-08-23', 0, 'On Airports....', '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp;As someone who travels nearly every week, I have encountered innumerable airports, and have become fascinated, and repulsed at times, by the variations in how they are operated. Since an airport serves as a sort of informal ambassador for a city or nation, it would seem worthwhile to examine some of the items which differentiate a good airport from a bad one.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In short, an airport can be a way for a city to be viewed in a superior way, simply by viewing an airport as more than a slightly high-end bus stop. The most monied people coming to and through your city will experience your airport. Making the experience a great one gives you an edge as a city destination.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As two examples of airports which I have frequented that are quite good, Munich and Tampa sort of stand out. They are not so enormous that they require orienteering skills to navigate, and they are spacious, comfortable, have free wi-fi, helpful staff etc. Tampa is one of my "home" airports, and I give it extra credit since I have spent enough time there for things to go badly, but aside from an occasional TSA debacle, they''ve done a great job.<br /><br />&nbsp; Since I am giving out compliments I may as well throw a spear. First prize for an airport that makes me insane is Frankfurt. It doesn''t even seem German to me (not efficient or organized in any logical way). The complexity of the place, along with the complete disdain I have encountered from staff there is what has prompted me to carefully book connections to/from Wroclaw through Munich. The Frankfurt airport is not visually pleasing, it does not have (at last visit) free wifi, it isn''t comfortable, there is not an abundance of restaurant selections. In short, I really dislike the airport, in a visceral sort of way.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Without further ado, here is my mental bombardment regarding the state of today''s airports:<br /><br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Simplify Transfers</span></b></div><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;For some airports this is not an issue at all as all carriers board and disembark at the gate. However, numerous airports around the world use buses as an alternative means of getting people to and from the aircraft. The stated reason is that it is a question of expense for the airline. They make a determination of which method to employ based upon the cost they incur using one method versus another.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;However, there is another question buried within this one. How can it be that the expense of using the gate (which was put there for the express purpose of getting to and from an aircraft) ends up being MORE costly to use than a bus which is operated by an outside vendor? The consensus I have from discussing this with fellow travelers is that the gate fee is set &nbsp;artificially high, creating an opportunity for an entrepreneur (see friend of someone within the hierarchy of the airport) to run a bus service to shuttle passengers back and forth to a plane.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Frankly, whatever the bus transfer should go the way of the dodo. It is one more step in an already tedious process of getting from point A to point B. You wait for your gate to open, then board a jammed bus, then are dropped at a plane (often within 100 meters of where your journey began), only to begin a que yet again. It would be least expensive, if somewhat problematic in certain weather, to just let passengers walk to the plane. In Europe and Asia many budget carriers handle things that way, and though you occasionally get wet or cold, it eliminates a pointless additional process.<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Free Unlimited Wifi</b></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;</b>To some this might seem a bit silly. Especially if you typically have short layovers. However, for those folks sitting for a few hours in an airport, the ability to "connect" if simply for entertainment value, is a major plus. Moreover, business travelers, who do not always have access to a business lounge, can make use of their prolonged layover by knocking out a few items on their to-do list.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In anticipation of the issues around trying to provide unlimited wifi to an increasingly video watching, bandwidth consuming audience, you can always pay for it through sponsorship. Offer a business the chance to be the "sponsor" of wifi for your airport. There are innumerable potential sponsors that would have an interest in people''s online behavior while in an airport, as well as perhaps simply having the interest of developing a bit of goodwill with the "captive" audience that is waiting for their next "literal" move.<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Provide Seats Designed for Humans</span></b></div><br />&nbsp; Before the purchasing manager buys seats for an airport, they should be forced to sit in them for over a hour. This would eliminate the sadomasochistic choices which seem to prevail in many airports. People transiting an airport actually need to occupy these seats. They often have, especially in larger airports, long layovers that make an extra bit of comfort quite welcome. Does this actually have to be brought to an airport designers attention.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ditto for seat quantity. If the size of an aircraft which can "dock" at a given gate has a maximum of 200 passengers, I''m guessing having at least 200 comfortable seats in the waiting area would be a good idea. The number of times I have had to mind a gate from afar is mind-boggling. Has someone broken the calculators of airport personnel?<br /><br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Duty Free - Really?</span></b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Here I will be brief. Once upon a time duty free items were actually inexpensive. Now the only reasons to buy duty free is that you want booze for Scandinavia (where almost any price would be a discount from the local one), the other is that you don''t feel like exchanging the remaining local currency you have, or finally, you have been away far too long and feel obligated to buy things for whomever at home is a bit sick of you being away. Otherwise, duty free is very rarely inexpensive, and often equal to normal retail prices. These shops will likely die under the weight of their own ineptitude and lack of competitive pricing.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></b></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><b>&nbsp; <span style="font-size: large;">Restaurants for Human Consumption</span></b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>For some reason dining in an airport is often an exercise in either a) paying extortionate rates for pathetic food or b) paying slightly less extortionate rates for pathetic food.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Foodies will bemoan my suggestion, but I honestly would love for airports everywhere to open things up to U.S. style chains. While the food is never "awesome" it is consistent, edible, and can be produced for a price that normal humans can tolerate paying even with the inevitable airport markup. Do I think Subway "rocks"? No, but I know the sandwich will be decent enough, and not cost a ridiculous sum of money. Ditto for McDonalds. Funny about McDonalds. Everyone bitches about them, but they seem to sell a lot of food.

The size of the entryways, the actual quantity of bathrooms, or stalls in bathrooms. In some instances, you can add an apparent lack of concern about the apparent hygiene of the bathroom and you have a truly toxic brew of nastiness. Overused and under maintained, wow. Now that makes an impression.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp;This is even more baffling considering the number of people who will pass through an airport must be a pretty predictable calculation.

The winner is....', '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Let''s put our hands together and give a big round of applause to.... nobody! That''s right, nobody submitted an essay for the $500 "Alphabet Success" contest. As much as I might be happy that the $500 will be staying in my company account, there is a much much bigger lesson here. <b>If you don''t try, you can''t win.&nbsp;</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, I could have done a countdown and reminded people, but as the time drew near I became curious whether anyone was going to make an entry. I even waited until it was 1:00am in Guam, the closest point to the international date line. Nope. Nada. Thus, we arrive at the question of why?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;One possibility is that nobody needed the money. Great news, apparently the global economy is much more robust than I had imagined. Frankly, I''m not sold on that theory. Somebody reading this, perhaps you, is thinking, <b>I should have sent the guy a quick page about "Alphabet Success" and I''d have had his $500. And you would be correct!</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; Another potential thesis is that I did not promote the contest enough. Maybe. But there are roughly 50,000 people on my Twitter account, another 1,550 on LinkedIn and to date there are roughly 1,400 copies of the book out in circulation. That would seem a large enough population to elicit at least a couple of responses. But I''ll take some of the blame for not "mashing" on the accelerator more as the date drew near to pique your interest. So there is a partial explanation, but seemingly not enough to have prevented any entries.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;My theory? People may have thought what''s the point? I hate writing, and I won''t win anyhow. Well, that''s not really the ABC (Always Be Committed) or JKL (Just Keep Looking) sort of attitude I was hoping to promote in the book. If you glanced at the numbers on my sites the raw data suggest that there was a reasonable shot of winning. <b>But you miss 100% of the shots you don''t take.&nbsp;</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;One other alternative? People might think, he''ll be looking at a few papers and my writing needs work (which would have been improved by trying..but anyhow) so I have no shot. I''ll tip my hand a little here and let you know that I would not have nor will I judge someone on the basis of their grammar or the poetry of their prose. <b>It is nice when language flows, but I was after a STORY.</b> So long as you can convey an example of something that happened, and relate it to a chapter in "Alphabet Success", that will be a solid contender.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;For what it is worth, I would have taken a powerful story over a finally crafted, but boring tale. But that''s water under the bridge. It''s August 1st, and the contest is over with no winner. Bummer.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;But wait,! What if we use this example to try another approach?&nbsp;<b>Let''s have a new contest, with a bigger prize and give you more time to write your story.</b> Shall we say October 31st? That''s almost two months from today. Same rules, same deal. I''ll update the contest rules, but in short, $500 for the best story &nbsp;related to a chapter in "Alphabet Success". It must be submitted by October 31st, 2013, no later than 5pm EST. All entries must be received at my e-mail address: tim.fargo@hammerfest.com.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; There you have it. A second chance! If you are interested, I suggest opening a document and just jotting down the most basic outline of what you are thinking. A couple of sentences. Then put a note in your calendar to get cracking at the earliest opportunity. Don''t get all jammed up worrying about appearances, and that nonsense, just take some time to write out your thoughts.

Be sure to invite the right people...', '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;"...Party over, oops, out of time." That was my 1999. &nbsp;Omega, my company, was about to grow well over 100% in revenue, coming in around $1.2M for the year. We''d only started in October of 1996 with a credit card and an idea. It was a bit like running fast downhill, sort of a controlled fall. Or, at least you try to maintain that illusion of control so you don''t crash and burn.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;As the year had begun I found out my family (spouse and I) was also about to grow by over 100%! Triplets were on the way. Certainly exciting news. Something that required some thinking considering the demands of the business, trying to occasionally exercise, and have some semblance of a personal life.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;So I did what any business school, professionally-trained accounting and finance graduate would do when faced with a multidimensional complex problem. I pretended it wasn''t actually happening.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;On August 3, any hope of maintaining my "bubble" was burst. Three very small and noisy creatures emerged from my wife. They were tougher than any client. Terrible communication skills. Either quiet, or screaming. Unable to form consensus, one would want food at midnight, another at 2am, then - (why not) 4:15am as well. Home became a nightmarish parody of a B&amp;B with 24-hour room service, and some extraordinarily demanding celebrity clientele.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Meanwhile the company kept pumping along. Growing in leaps and bounds, though much more civilized than home. People that were selected for their ability, and their ability to work together. It was an essential element of keeping the place together. There were so many people squeezed into the office that one person had to accept that the coffee machine would be on their desk. The head of IT shared an office with me. When I say we were "in it together" it is quite literal.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;You may be asking, "Why didn''t you get more space?". A great question. We were trying. Boy were we trying. But it was "dot-com" days. Everyone was partying like it was 1999. Except the dot-com people often had VC money and a bank line. We had a credit card, a factoring company, and a balance sheet that would have embarrassed the Zimbabwe. Thus, the reception from potential landlords was less than welcoming.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;We finally did get more space. We finally found a landlord that would take us in. The kids finally started sleeping through the night. We got rid of our factor and found a bank that would lend to us. We even had a break room. Sometimes I''d just splash out like that. Even had free coffee. That''s just how I roll.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;We partied like 1999 all right. It was non-stop insanity. By the end of the year we were less than four years away from being sold. It wasn''t on anyone''s mind. There was no time for big "end game" thinking, we were in triage mode. Not to mention we''d begun development of some cutting edge technology for the investigative world which we''d launch around the kids first birthday. (see link at bottom of page)</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking back, that was a defining time for me, and most of the people at Omega Insurance Services. Many of whom I still maintain contact with. We had a fantastic team, and we did amazing things. It was inspiration, adrenaline, camaraderie, and some organization tossed in where needed to fill the gaps.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Many of those people have gone on to pretty awesome things. There were quite a few entrepreneurs in the pack, with several people starting firms within the insurance industry, and others going off into unrelated fields. It was, as I mentioned, an extraordinary group of people. I''d love to tell you I did it. That it was my incredible genius that made it all possible. But that, my friends, would be a lie.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Like all successful parties, it takes a great group of people, with the right chemistry to make for a memorable evening. We did party like it was 1999, for about seven years.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily I sent the invitations to the right people.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The kids are soon 14.

Some of our best ads use them, and many of our fondest memories are of a good shared laugh.

Why?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; During the course of running Omega Insurance Services into the Inc. 500 twice, I would say there were very few days that passed where we didn''t all bust up laughing over something.

Why?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Because <u>a) It is free. It cost nothing to have a fun work environment.</u> You might have to be at the end of the joke at times. If that''s the greatest pain you every feel, lucky you. <u>b) It loosens people up.</u> This is a huge advantage. People who are not worried about their next move relax and get the job done, instead of spending an inordinate amount of time worried about their "image". <u>c) It is infectious. People like to be with fun people.</u> Customers feel it, prospective employees feel it. It ends up permeating the company. Why does that matter?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;It matters because all those things lead to a <u>better bottom line</u>. You''ll make more money if people are enjoying themselves. They''re not spending time complaining, their not sitting worried about their job, or some goofy gossip.

People now expect a smashing level of professional marketing heaped upon them when they look into something new. I did not and do not really offer that at present.

Yoo-hoo Microsoft...', '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;You don''t have to be a technophobe to experience some dismay at the seemingly constant barrage of changes and alterations to technologies and programs that have become part of our daily discourse with the world. Let me tell you a secret...I want my antivation!</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; Just when you feel the initial joy of mastery, the technology is re-engineered to be more user-friendly. Gasp! This puts us in the unenviable position of having to discard some hard earned work and begin anew. While I am hardly opposed to personal growth, having companies with whom I have <i>formed a relationship</i> kick dirt into the hole I was digging is a little annoying. Antivation please.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;This got me thinking. There must be an emerging market for some technological stabilization. With the baby boomer generation growing older, and in many cases already a bit impervious to change, this is a major opportunity. Microsoft could hang onto the code for Windows 7, for instance. Have a team tightening the code, making the software faster, more reliable and secure, and clawing away at consumer feedback on ways to simplify the whole experience. Then charge annually for licensing (fixed) &nbsp;and support (a la carte), which I think will be a huge profitable growth area, with boomers aging. Um, antivation?</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The underlying technology need not suffer. As we inevitably move to 128-bit tech and onward, there would be plenty of room to make the program optimized for the new environment. Innoantivation?</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Frankly, I could apply this logic to phones as well. My Samsung Galaxy 3 is a joy. Love it. But I am curious what else of true value can be offered that would make me want to migrate to a new phone. Using the camera as an example, I only need 8 megapixels. The photos I shoot with the phone are capturing <i>moments</i>. Issues of pixelization etc, are not likely to factor in to me moving to a "new model." It handles e-mail, texting, web interaction, and a host of things I am only now unearthing. "Waiter, I ordered ANTIVATION, not innovation. May I please have the old version?"</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;My central point is that with a large generation cohort getting to the "get off my lawn" stage of life, perhaps a new market is upon us. Antivation. Companies make the technology we''re already used to better, (much cheaper development than "new and improved") and more reliable. If they want to expand the memory of the hardware model and increase the processor speed, great. Just don''t fiddle with the basic design and interface. And, by all means, send me an annual bill to allow me the privilege of locking in my comfort zone.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;While I have not done any formal market research on this, frequent lunch and dinner chats with folks lead me to believe this is not some fanciful idea. It is a new bona-fide market. (In fact, at a recent dinner in Stockholm I listened to a smart, young university student questioning the same issue.) And I think it is growing, with a group of people who will pay the annual fee NOT to learn a new technology.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Before you (if you haven''t already) dismiss me as being against progress. Think again. Innovation is NOT just what happens in the Silicon Valley, it is also how we use that technology in our life. Users frequently find novel, unexpected uses for technologies. But like everything, these need time to emerge, Burying the user side of the equation under your well intention, but unneeded, upgrade, is frustrating and actually counterproductive. I''m asking the large companies to engage in ANTIVATION both to accommodate what I think is a growing market of "what the hell is this" consumers, and an existing group of tech savvy people who would happily tweek the heck out of your existing app. Both of whom I guess would pay an annual "tick" not to be forced into re-engineering the technological ecosystem they''ve built for themselves.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;It certainly merits some thought.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Now get off my lawn!</span><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/P9kYro" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Alphabet Success, your personal step-ladder to success. &nbsp;To buy, click here.&nbsp;</a></div></div>', '', '', 1, 1, 0, 'in-defense-of-antivation-and-a-way-to-profit-from-it-yoo-hoo-microsoft'),

Most kids I grew up with, and most I meet today have big dreams, big plans for their future. But somewhere along the line, they get the fight beaten out of them. It could be a parent who tells them to get â€œtheir head out of the cloudsâ€, or it might be friends who, while well intentioned, don''t want to see you leave them behind. Even for those with the courage and resolve to overcome the â€œbattleâ€ with family and friends, get ground down by circumstances, and one too many failed attempts at their dream. Eventually, they get so â€œworn downâ€ that success looks like paying the bills and hanging onto the job they hate.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   But that isn''t always how the story ends.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   In April 1961, &nbsp;I arrived, at least in breathing form, here on our lovely plant. Unlike many people, there were much more than two people involved in my continued existence. My biological parents, who put me up for adoption, my parents who three short months after I was born took care of me as their own, and the nuns of Our Lady of Victory, who though I don''t remember them, handled the three month gap. Given my lack of self-sufficiency at that point, I thank them all for getting me started.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   One of my mom''s favorite stories was about the ride home from the orphanage to their home in Akron. Mom had on a pearl necklace which apparently I fiddled with constantly. She always mentioned that, as well as the fact that I laughed quite a lot. That latter part hasn''t changed much over the years.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   You may wonder, well this is all a little interesting, but not really what I showed up for Tim.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   The back story to my adoption is a tale of remarkable determination and grit.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   You see, my adoptive mother could not have children. Now that, is not, in and of itself, especially unique. Many people adopt children for the very same reason. But my mom found out about her inability to have children the hard way.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   My mom was pregnant four times before she tried adoption. All four were either stillborn or died shortly after being born. That alone would have put most people in a mind to forget the whole idea. Not my parents. Her and my father looked into adopting at a local agency. If they could not have their own, they would adopt a child.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   Of immediate concern to the authorities was why this woman, my mother, was unable to have children. They came to the determination that, after a few tests, she had a blood disease or abnormality (later learned to be Lupus). Upon reaching that conclusion, they decided to reject my parents application to adopt as my mother was seen as â€œhigh riskâ€. OK, this is about time to say, well, maybe we can get a dog, or a couple of them even. Not my mother.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   Afterward they had a lengthy chat with their family physician. He was aware that my mom had something wrong with her blood. But he nonetheless suggested they conduct another blood test, just in case they''d missed something. He took my mother''s blood and sent her and my father home.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   In the meantime he did something which can only be described as beautiful, reckless and amazing. He also took his wife''s blood, and sent it for testing in lieu of my mother''s which he knew would never pass testing. His wife''s blood was fine. But since it was submitted with my mother''s name, she was now â€œfitâ€ to be an adoptive mother. At least according to her blood.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   Fearing being called out locally, they headed to another adoption center they had heard about. There they found a receptive audience who agreed to put them on the list. In those days it was a list you actually were likely make it through, as adoption was not nearly as widespread as it is today. Their name accepted, they headed back to Akron to wait.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   In what I have to guess was late June or early July of 1961, they got a call that the adoption center had a baby available. They were warned, that the child had â€œlarge eyesâ€. Undaunted they made the trek to the center and had a look at the â€œBig Eyed Babyâ€, and yes that was me.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We never chatted about it, but apparently I was insufficiently â€œBig-Eyedâ€ to prevent them from saying â€œsure, we''ll take that oneâ€. A couple of weeks later in mid-July, they once again made the journey from Akron to the adoption center. This time they had something to take home. That being me. Yahoo!</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   That was incredibly lucky for me! If they had not gone through all those trials and tribulations, I might have ended up virtually anywhere. Instead I had an incredible set of parents who, in spite of my efforts to the contrary at times, managed to turn me into something resembling a normal human being. And apparently I sort of â€œgrew intoâ€ my eyes.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   Thus, in part, as with most success stories, a big part of mine was a matter of incredible timing, luck, and maybe even â€œbig eyesâ€. But the absolutely biggest part of what got me into a position to succeed was my mother and father''s determination to just keep looking. If they had given up, I may never have been afforded the opportunities which came to me later in life. In addition, that attitude of determination was infectious. Obviously not inherited genetically, I developed a tenacity that has yet to leave me.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   The quotes, the one liners, all the cliches about â€œstaying the courseâ€, well they are true. Occasionally someone gets remarkably lucky, but more often, failure is the road you will be driving on far longer than you want, if you hope to succeed. Now, you better be adapting along the way, and learning from that failure, otherwise youâ€™re not a failure, you''re a fool.</span></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">   Failure is the road you will travel to success.

(62, 'Tim Fargo''s Blog', '2013-07-15', 0, 'Social Media Maladies...', '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">We have a problem. Or rather, there are some folks with a problem. They have latched onto the social media universe without first addressing their existing condition. A complete disconnect between their marketing and their operations.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;As an example: Nobody expects velvet glove treatment from Ryanair (an European budget carrier). They don''t promise it, and they don''t deliver it. You get: a seat, take off, and landing. Everything else is pretty much an add-on. While sometimes people moan about it, they haven''t really broken their promise. We might find their handling a bit akin to that of an aggressive shepard, but that is us just not being used to their model. Once you accept the model, as promised, you understand it. And as they would like tell you, "take it, or leave it." They do take off and land, and they make money. Pretty simple.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;I use Ryanair. I am never disappointed. The conditions are known to me in advance, and I accept them in exchange for a great airfare, and often, the avoidance of a connecting flight. In relationship terms: <i>We have an understanding.</i></span><br /><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;It is much, much worse to splash out money on all this touchy feely social media blather being concocted without the people writing it having an in-depth understanding of the service or product they are writing about. As an "Elite" member of a couple of &nbsp;"conventional" airline programs, and a very frequent traveler, there is ripe territory here for examples.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">&nbsp; This fresh off the press at Lufthansa''s Twitter feed:&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;"> "It''s a new dawn, it''s a new day, it''s a new life... And I''m feeling good" </span><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Really? Well, I am a customer and I am not. Where are my missing air miles? The one''s I wrote you about in April. Did they go missing with the "new dawn"?</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;">   There has been plenty of communication with the Lufthansa Miles and More program. I have had a few problems with flights where I doubled checked that my number was on file and still did not get credit for the flight. OK, stuff happens. <u>One example</u>: On April 20th of this year I contacted them with information about miles missing from one flight segment, on a two segment ticket. The e-mail promised: "</span></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We received your feedback with the number COM-1187086 and will start the processing immediately." </span><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">I hate to be predictable, but you might already gather it did not happen, even though I sent them a copy of the boarding pass.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">Subsequently I wrote them again, and was promised an answer in 30 days. When I responded (with a bit of anger) that it had already been requested before, I got this automaton response:</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">"</span></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Thank you for your enquiry.</span><br /><div id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80976" style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-family: ''Helvetica Neue'', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><span id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80975" style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><br />The processing of your request could take&nbsp;<strong>up to 30 working days</strong>&nbsp;(excluding weekends and holidays) and we trust that we can count on your patience.&nbsp;</span></div><div id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80982" style="background-color: white;"><span id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80981"></span><br /><div id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80980" style="color: #454545; font-family: Verdana, ''Sans Serif''; font-size: 9pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 3px; padding: 0px;"><span id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80981"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Kind regards,</span></span></div><span id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80981"><div id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80983" style="color: #454545; font-family: Verdana, ''Sans Serif''; font-size: 9pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 3px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><br />Miles &amp; More Service Centre</div><div id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80983" style="color: #454545; font-family: Verdana, ''Sans Serif''; font-size: 9pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 3px; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><div id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80983" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 3px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="color: #454545;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>The main point is the cavernous disconnect with their positively chirpy Tweet and the reality of dealing with them after using their service and simply asking them to credit an account as promised. With reference to the above mail - "Um, maybe you cannot count on my patience, it left the building." Sadly, and they likely know this, I have limited other options, <u>but I have left them for protracted period before even though it is a massive hassle to do so</u>.&nbsp;</span></div><div id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80983" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 3px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Times, ''Times New Roman'', serif;">&nbsp; Obviously I am angry. Why? Because they didn''t do what they promised. If there was no Miles and More program, I wouldn''t have a single thing to complain about. The flights were fine, I got where I needed to, the Lufthansa personnel on board were pretty good. But execution extends to every promise made. If you doubt this, try it out in a personal relationship.</span></div><div id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80983" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 3px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Times, ''Times New Roman'', serif;"><br /></span></div><div id="yui_3_7_2_1_1373816262341_80983" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 3px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Times, ''Times New Roman'', serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;That needs to be thought about in every communication. Social media or otherwise. You are telling us who you are, and what you are going to do for us. Frankly, the ability to fix areas of disconnect is an opportunity to really shine.

There are some similarities to "normal" life, but the way to the goal line isn''t clear. Frankly, a lot of people say they know the way but I''m not so sure that they really know.

(and other tech companies).', '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp;In a NY Times article today, it was outlined how Microsoft is now restructuring to be more like Apple. Hmmm...that''s interesting. Microsoft (up 28.45% over 12 months) is playing follow the "leader with Apple (stock down 27.12% over 12 months. What? Hey, they''re flying off a cliff, let''s go too....Bon Voyage.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft has been the company that Apple never managed to be. Apple had a great last run under Jobs and he made some amazing contributions before he left us, and that effect seems to linger a bit, but I would say the party is over for Apple. They turned a tech company into a consumer products firm with the hip factor of a night club. That''s great. But as someone who lived in South Beach for ages, it isn''t a model you''d want to count on long-term. Fashion is fickle. Very fickle.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Why not give in on some non-core businesses where they have been banging their brains against the wall to the tune of billions? I know search is important, but I think Google has pretty much ended that discussion, at least as far as Microsoft''s own internal development potential is concerned. An acquisition - maybe, but I think they are in a vapor lock on internal development.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover and more importantly, Microsoft can, with a modest effort, hang on to their highly profitable desktop/laptop OS ad infinitum. (or at least for a very long time). Why not focus on integrating some of their "old" Windows 7 software into a increasingly faster and faster, as well as more stable platform. People thought I was nuts when I was scrambling in December to latch onto a couple of high powered Windows 7 64-bit laptops. Why?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Because I knew they were playing the "let''s fiddle with the interface"game with Windows 8. Sure enough they blew that to pieces.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This brings me to my central thesis.While I know that there are a never ending array of new tech products coming to market offering yet another alleged incremental benefit, those benefits are starting to seem mighty thin. It seems to me that <u>perfecting execution of what they have been offering is a far superior and profitable plan</u>. In addition, it would allow third-party developers to actually catch up, and clean up their offerings.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;My dream? An actual interconnected world where I can easily interact on my TV with my PC and Phone. Some of this is available, but much of it is still subject to painful "not as advertised integration". With every iteration of the "better interface" comes a host of bugs, and connectivity issues. Not to mention trying to figure out where everything went from the former interface. Phone, PC, tablet, the issues remain the same.<br /><br />&nbsp; Why does any of this matter? I''m just a retired business guy, albeit only 52. Well, I was one of the first to buy a PC when they came out at in the 1980s. People actually came to see my double 5.25" floppy system from Radio Shack. Wow. Then I did the unthinkable and got a 20Mb hard drive. A Ferrari at the time.<br /><br />&nbsp; I understand technology. Maybe not as a programmer or system manager, but it isn''t scary to me. When something new arrives, I like to see what it has to offer. In short, not a Luddite.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;But there is a MASSIVE wave of baby boomers who will be wanting to use the internet, and their PC etc. and there is a pretty substantial amount of revenue there. Will &nbsp;someone wake up and realize that they view the PC about the same as a screwdriver. It is a tool. The problem is it is a tool that keeps morphing into something new, and their desire (anecdotal but likely true) to continually adapt to new is fading. Steady and reliable is going to be BIG.<br /><br />&nbsp; So instead of launching Windows 8, 9 10 or whatever, try making 7 as elegant as possible. You can charge people an <u>annual subscription</u>&nbsp;for ongoing support and development of that program and my guess is that they''d jump on it. If Microsoft wants a new division, I suggest LEGACY OPPORTUNITIES. Yes, keep innovating, but remember that folks are (even some much younger than me) getting weary of learning a new phone, a new OS interface. Just make the one you have UNBREAKABLE. <u>The profit in this will far surpass the continual effort to develop a system that will have great specs. If memory serves, that''s rather the point of running a business.</u><br /><br />&nbsp; Improving, and streamlining existing OS code and apps isn''t nearly as sexy as launching a new "idea'' (with the shelf life of raw chicken in the jungle). But it is a puzzle as worthy of figuring out as any. And I''ll stand by my assertion that it is a <u>much more profitable</u> path to chase. Any takers out there in Techville?</div>', '', '', 1, 1, 0, 'way-to-go-microsoft-and-other-tech-companies'),

Card replaced, charges declined and washed away. Parting words, "Thank you for your patience Mr. Fargo in dealing with this today. Is there anything else we can do for you at American Express?" &nbsp;Classy, and followed up quickly with an e-mail confirming the conversation.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Based on my experience yesterday, yes there is something American Express can do for me. Conduct a hostile takeover of Facebook and teach the youngsters to remember who keeps the lights on.

As a frequent traveler, the card has some significant benefits that I wanted. But alas they refused my application. I then tried calling and making a fuss, speaking to supervisors etc. Still, no change, the answer was NO. In the spirit of my entry, and in keeping with my personality, I opted to contact their Private Banking group.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Now I do realize, that not everyone is a potential Private Banking client.

By getting the card I qualified for some special privileges that saved me about $3,000 on hotel rooms I''ll be staying in over the next couple of months. While I do value my time pretty highly, getting a quick $1,500 a hour seemed reasonable enough as compensation.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want something, you need to be willing to JLK - Just Keep Looking.

Beats the concocting of curses.</p><p dir=ltr>&#160; &#160;When you realize that your daily encounters with incompetent people are actually a fertile field of opportunites waiting to be seized, your frame of reference changes. People placed in the wrong position, and frequently, companies that have been unchallenged for so long they have simply stopped trying. The latter is a truly fantastic opportunity.</p><p dir=ltr>&#160; &#160;So, the next time you see a situation begin to unfold that has the potential to make you crazy remember MNO - Make Notes and Observations.

But one thing or another kept standing in the proverbial path. Now we have clearance. Prepare for takeoff.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Today''s Note - with a regrettable thanks to the disappointing performance of so many companies I deal with for providing me with such a surplus of potential examples of what NOT to do.</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So, what''s the big deal about my little book. Well, there are a myriad of examples I could provide.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Let''s just say I think that most businesses make their lives (such as they are) harder than they need to be. This is why my subtitle is "keeping it simple".</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When I started Omega Insurance Services in 1996, my vision was to create a nationwide insurance investigative firm that provided consistent results. A great deal of things went into making that happen. Some, but not all, of which are alluded to in the book. But at the center of every business success is the execution of delivering a promise or series of promises.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We arrive at the topic of chapter one - ABC - Always Be Committed.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This is where most businesses come apart. The plumber who shows up late (fail to deliver as to time). The airline that advertises at great expense how much they care, and then has personnel that &nbsp;treat you like livestock headed to slaughter at the airport. The technology company that sells you their "user-friendly"wireless router that requires you several hours to set up. The events that leave you at the end of the day with that vacant look in your eyes.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now, you might fairly argue, as an executive of a company this is one of the listed examples, that things do sometimes go wrong. OK, that''s fair. Which bring us to the second level of failure. Not making it right when it accidentally went wrong.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This time, I''ll begin with a positive example. I order an amazing amount of stuff from Amazon. Not only in the U.S., but also the UK as well as their facility in Germany. As such, it is hardly surprising that things have, on occasion, gone wrong. Late delivery, or something screwed up in the shipment (missing or broken). It is a very low percentage, but it does happen. When it does, Amazon makes fixing it very very simple. Their service is very user friendly. They do have some policies that prevent them from accepting your two year old toaster as a return, but my experience has been nothing but exemplary.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Contrast that with a recent experience with DHL. I was trying to track down an inbound shipment that seemed to have gone missing. I had my tracking number and all the sort of information you learn from experience you better have to get answers. In an effort to ensure I have a paper trail, I nearly always opt for e-mail exchanges with people. So, I asked them about a package that &nbsp;in their own system was shown (correctly) as being <u><b>destined for Poland</b></u>.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Here is their response - directly cut and pasted from the e-mail:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13.600000381469727px;">Dear Mr. Fargo,</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-size: 13.600000381469727px;" /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13.600000381469727px;">thank you for your request.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-size: 13.600000381469727px;" /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13.600000381469727px;">Please be informed that after the shipment has left Germany, the local post of UK (Royal Mail/Parcelforce) is responsible for delivery and data transmission, not DHL Germany.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13.600000381469727px;">For questions regarding the delivery please contact your local post in UK.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-size: 13.600000381469727px;" /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13.600000381469727px;">Kind regards,</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-size: 13.600000381469727px;" /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #454545; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13.600000381469727px;">H.

Even if it means being out of pocket and taking a loss. The bad will generated by the actions of many companies are only overcome when they are the only option for a certain item or need. That is an increasingly rare situation.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Always Be Committed. Not when it suits you. Not when it is easy. Make it happen. You promised.
